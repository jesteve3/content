            <div type="item"><head> Offical Spelling</head>
            <p> HAs not the time arrived for a stereotyped
            spelling of the names of towns and villages in
            Egypt! The present variety is more con-
            fusing than pleasing. The Journel Officiel
            often contains several spellings fo the same
            place according as the name is being used by
            the Public Works, Railway, Finance or
            other administraion. Nor is an administration
            always uniform in its method, for the Railway
            Administration sometimes exhibits in time-
            table, telegrphic guide, tickets, station home-
            boards, and lamps all the various forms of
            spelling. Here are some illustrations of variety
            taken from official sources:Kalioubieh, Galiou-
            bieh, Qualiubia; Guzieh, Guiza, Giza; Kena,
            Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut;
            Ebchan, Ebshan, Ibshan; Barqnaqs, Barknaks.
            When names can be found indifferently
            under the inital K Kh H C G or Q it is quite
            a labor to consuly an index.</p></div>

                <p> Some years ago the Indian Government
                adopted a uniform system of spelling on the
                Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it
                is quite time the Egyptian Government did the
                same. The stereotyped form could be left to the
                Survey Department, who have already nearly
                completed a survey of Egypt embracing every
                single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit.
                This department could issue a general index,
                and also a geographical list with mudiriehs,
                districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much
                use in fixing exact name and locality. Press
                notices of village occurrences are at times
                very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud,
                often erroneously called Tel, is now spelt
                Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The names
                of natives is a great source of error, and a
                properly-spelt list would be of much ser-
                vice. A native's identity is at times lost in
                the vagaries of spelling.</p>

            <p>Tokio, January 1.</p>
            <p>The Japanese yesterday, after exploding a
            series of minus, stormed and captured Sung-shu-shou, one of the most important of the remaining forts at Port Arthur. The Russians exploded mines as they were retreating. A portion of the garrison was buried under the
            debris but rescued by the Japanese, who
            captured some guns. The Japanese losses were
            small. There is every indication that the
            defensive power is weakening.</p>
            <p>The Japanese to day captured H fort and
            the new Palung-shan fort, together with the

            <p>During the week ending on Saturday last
            57 deaths from bovine typhus were reported
            throughout Egypt During the corresponding
            period last year, 7,169 deaths were reported.
            A slight recrudescence of the disease is noted
            daring the last week, but this is entirely of a
            local character, confined to the provinces of
            Gharbieh and Ghizeh.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of the outbreak the
            cattle of the localities infected and neighbouring villages have been inoculated with
            serum. This has always checked the development oI the disease. The quantity of serum at the disposal of the Sanitary Administration is
            amply sufficient for inoculation in case of
            local outbreaks, and a constant supply is
            furnished by the Serum Farm. The Administration baa every ground for the hope that
            the disease will have disappeared by the end
            of this year.</p>
            <p>The serum seems to have little or no protective effect with animals coming from
            Cyprus, many of which, though inoculated,
            have succumbed to the disease. Similar
            experiments have been dumJc in India on
            animals coming from the mountains and from
            the plains. The cattle of the plains are protected by the serum, which, however, has little
            or no effect on the mountain cattle, even when
            employed in strong doses. Under these conditions the Sanitary Administration considers
            die importation of Cypriote cattle, as long as
            the epidemic lasts, to be a mistake, as these
            animals are sure to be infected sooner or later.</p></div>

            outside hospital at Kafr el Fokaha, in the
            Toukh Markaz.</p>
            <p>During the week ending the 31st December,
            15 cases of bubonic plague occurred throughout
            Egypt. An increase appears in the number of
            cases occurring at Suez last week. It appears
            from the report that I have received from
            Dr. Cresswell and from my own observations,
            (says Sir H. Pinching in his report) that
            these cases are due to infection conveyed by
            rata, which had been infected themselves by
            goods coming from India or Upper Egypt.
            One of the persons attacked by plague at
            Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains
            large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta
            and tea from Madras. In moving the cases
            containing these goods the dead bodies of rats
            were found. Large quantities of beans have
            also been imported from Upper Egypt, where
            cases of plague occurred this year, the last of

            THE NEW TARIFF.</head>
            <p>The new tariff which came into force yesterday on the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Company's line has aroused a considerable
            amount of indignation among the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Mr. IL II. Birch sends us the following communication on the subject:—</p>
            <p>The directors of tho Ramleh Railway Company, Ltd., have issued a notice that no further contract tickets will be issued after 31st December, 1904, end that in place of them “carnets,” or books of tickets, will be provided at a price which more-than doubles the cost of the yearly contract. The reasons given for this new departure are-</p>
            <p>I “That many contract holders refuse to
            show their tickets to the conductors when
            called upon to do so, and abuse and even
            assault them." The remedy for this is to send
            the offenders before tho Tribunals, and exac
            the penalty for their misconduct.</p>
            <p>II“The company is now a tramway company and no such companies in Europe issue contract tickets.” To this the reply is that it was a railway company when the concession was obtained from the Egyptian Government, and if it has suited the direction to convert the railway into a tramway for their own benefit, it is no reason why the public should be sacrificed.</p>
            <p>The Government, having granted a monopoly
            to the company, should take care that this
            monopoly is not abused. The contract holders
            are mostly old residents, and it is not only
            the proceeds of their tickets that benefit the
            company, but also a further benefit accrues
            from the members of their households and
            guests who visit them and who do not hold
            contracts. What is to be the result of this
            new regulation? The increased charge is
            altogether immensurate to the service rendered by the company. Numbers of people will have to leave Ramleh, and rents, house property, and land will all decrease in value. It behoves everybody to protest energetically against this regulation, which is unjustifiable from ad points of view.</p>
            <p>This morning we interviewed one of the
            members of the board of the company, Mr.
            Lumbroso, who gave us the following exposition of the directors’ standpoint:—</p>
            <p>In no country in the world are there season
            tickets for electric trams, but only books of
            tickets. After the electrification of the line,
            and out of consideration for the public’s demands, season tickets were issued on the condition that every season ticket holder should have his photograph in the ticket case and
            should show it whensoever asked by the company’s servants. But, continued Mr. Lumbreso,
            this system has been rendered impossible
            owing to the "mauvaise volonte” of the public
            and of the tricks played upon the company by
            -false season ticket holders, who insulted and
            attacked the employees when asked to show
            their tickets. The directors have had to stop
            issuing season tickets, and have reduced the
            price of packets of 50 tickets for the first
            class from P.T. 38 to P.T. 75 and for the
            second class from P.T. 4.7 to P.T. 37J. This,
            said Mr. Lumbroso, was a sacrifice made by
            the company for the sake of the public, since
            on a total of about L.E. 50,000 the amount
            realized from season tickets was only L.E. 8,000.
            On the other hand, tho above must take into
            consideration the fact that if the present price
            of the books of ticket appears to be higher
            than the season ticket rate, the new system
            has the advantage of allowing them to give
            away the tickets in the books to their families
            and servants if they wish to.</p></div>

            LIABILITIES £180,000.</head>
            <p>The heavy fail in American cotton has led to the failure of one of the leading Syrian capitalists in Egypt, Mr. Selim Tawil, who belongs to a family which is well known at Alexandria, and whose business connections were very extensive. His speculations were chiefly directed to American cotton, and on Friday last he found himself unable to pay his differences. The amount he has failed for is said to be £180,000. As the Bourse and all the banks are closed today it is impossible for us to obtain complete details of the failure.</p>

<head> A NEW SUEZ CANAL</head>
<head> French Views</head>
<head> Important Interview</head>
<p>The Paris corrrespondent of the Standard,
writing under date of the 18th December sends
the following interesting article to that news-
paper:-</p>
<p>The telegraphic announcement received here
from London that Sir Theodore Angier, of the
shipping firm of Messrs. Angier Brothers, hi
declared that the plans are complete for a
second Canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and
that the contractors are ready to commence its
construction, was calculated to mislead the
general public into the belief that such a second
Canal would really be cut without delay, un-
less to use the words of the despatch, “British
cargo vessels received fairer treatment at the
hands of the present Canal Company."</p>
<p>Before referring to the grievances of certain
shipowners, it is right to point out that the
Suez Canal Company possesses a monopoly
which will not expire till the Canal, at the end
of its concession in about seventy years, passes
into the possession of the Egyptian Govern-
ment. It is, of course, possible that the present
Canal Company should, through violation of
its concession, be pronounced to have forfeited
its monopoly; but at the present time the
complaints do not go so far as that.</p>
<p>It is probable that if the present Company
failed to keep its engagements, the Egyptian
Government, would quash its monopoly, and
perhaps grant another concession to a new
company; but, the British Government, which
possesses no fewer than 176,000 of the Suez
Canal Shares, and has its representatives on the
Board of Directors, has formulated no com-
plaint against the management of the enterprise
which produces for a sufficiently large revenue
to be of appreciable value to the English
Treasury.</p>
<p>If the Canal were mismanaged, the British
Government, as the largest shareholder, would
certainly be the first to complain; but under
present circumstances its representatives are
in perfect accord with the president and other
members of the board of directors, so that
is scarcely likely to advise the Khedive to
grant a concession for a second Canal.</p>
<p>Even supposing the concession were granted
by the Egyptian Government, there would
still remain the question of the Sovereignty
of the Sultan, and of the validity of that con-
cession without the ratification of the Porte.
It is, therefore, clear that if the plans for the
cutting of a second Canal are already prepared,
the moment has not yet come when the con-
tractors can commence their work.</p>
<p>With regard to the Canal dues charged on
the spaces on deck capable of being utilised
for cargo, M. Bonnet, the general secretary
of the Company, assured me to-day that the
regulations for the measurement of those deck
spaces were in complete accord with the deci-
sions of the Constantinople Conference, and
that, moreover, the Board of Trade approved
them. Certain spaces on deck available for
cargo were still exempt, and were only taxed
for the payment of Canal dues after it had
been demonstrated beyond doubt by the ship-
owner himself that they were destined to be oc
copied with cargo by cargo being found in them.
After a vessel has once presented itself in the
Canal with cargo in such previously exempted
spaces, those spaces are for the future always
included in the tonnage on which the Canal
tolls are calculated.</p>
<p>After reading the interview with Sir Theo-
dore Angier, published in The Standard
of Saturday, I called again on M. Bonnet, who
is leaving for Egypt on Tuesday with Prince
d'Arenborg. Their visit to the Isthmus is in
no way connected with the present agitation
in favour of constructing an opposition canal
but is simply the annual visit of inspection al-
ways made by the President of the Suez Cana
Company.</p>
<p>Sir Theodore Angier (as reported in your
issue of December 16) said to your representa-
tives :—"We defeated Mr. Gladstone's assump-
tion of a monopolist right, and he had to con-
foss-that he was wrong. We got a new con-
cession."</p>
<p>“Both these statements,” said M. Bonnet to
me today, “are absolutely incorrect. Mr
Gladstone never contested the Company's
monopoly, and no concession was ever granted
for a second Canal."</p>
<p>The exclusive character of the Suez Canal
Company's concession is unquestionable, espe-
cially as no one contests that the Canal now
completely answers the requirements of the
shipping using it. Sir Theodore Angier com-
plains that the Suez Canal Company has in
many ways violated what is known as “the
London programme," signed in 1883. M
Bonnet's reply on this point was very clear
He said to me, in substance: —‘Sir Theodore
Angier contends that our tonnage measurements
are arbitrary. The fact is that every vessel
using the Canal has two certificates of tonnage.
In the case of British ships,t he Board of Trade
gives first its home certificate of tonnage, and
secondly a Suez Canal certificate, established in
conformity with the regulations of that Com-
pony, drawn up by the Constantinople Con-
ference. Tee Suez Canal authorities naturally
base their Canal dues on this latter certificate,
and make no-arbitrary charges."</p>
<p>“With regard to the question of the di-
vidend, taken in connection with the re-
duction of Canal dues,” went on M. Bonnet
“the ‘London programme' suggested that the
future augmentation of the profits of the
enterprise should be applied in equal parts
to increase the dividend on the shares and
to reduce the Canal dues. Thus, in 1883
when the dividend on the shares was only
93 francs, the Company made its customers,
the shipowners, 4 present of half its even-
toal increased profits. This agreement has
been kept so for several years till 1891,
when there was no surplus to divide, whilst
later on the surplus was sufficient only to
permit of an annual redaction of a few cen-
times per ton. It was unanimously agreed
between all the French and foreign Directors
of the Canal that the reduction of dues
should operate each time the surplus allow-
ed of a reduction of 50 centimes per ton,
and not before."</p>
<p>“If the reduction of one or a fraction
of a centime were made annually, the Com-
pany," said the secretary, "would run the
risk of being obliged in a bad year to
reduce its dividend without being able to
increase the Canal dues. Moreover the divi-
sion of surplus profits is based on tho dm-
dend at the moment of the last diminution
of the toll."</p>
<p>“It was also promised on the ‘London pro-
gramme,’ " pursued M. Bonnet, “that after
the dividend on the shares should have
reached 25 per cent., or 125 francs per share, 
the totality of the surplus profits should
go towards the reduction of the Canal dues.
That moment arrived quicker than was
anticipated ; and, immediately the surplus
profits allow of the reduction of the present
toll of 8 francs 50 centimes per ton by 50 cen-
times, the diminution will be effected. In the
meantime the dividend has increased and will
increase, and the further surplus profits,
after each reduction of the toll by 50 cen-
times, will, as heretofore, be calculated on the
dividend declared simultaneously with the
lowering of the toll. Till now this interpretation 
of the ‘London programme' has been uncon-
tested, and it would evidently be impossible
to get the shareholders of any oompany to 
accept the position of the certainty of no 
increase in their dividend with the possibility,
and even the probability, of a reduction in 
their income owing to the fact of all the 
surplus profits being employed to reduce tolls
which might, in the case of a period of
prosperity being followed by one of commercial
depression, have been brought down so low as
to entail a very heavy lost to the share-
holders."</p>
<p> “The next reduction of fifty centimes in the
toll will take place," added M. Bonnot, “when
the dividend on the share capital has reached
one hundred and thirty-five francs. Each ten
francs increase of the dividend will correspond 
for the future with a reduction of fifty centimes
in the toll."</p>
<p>As to Sir Theodore Angior’s idea that the
British directors should be appointed by the
British shipowners, M. Bonnet pointed out to
me what Prince d'Arenborg wrote some weeks 
ago, and he declared there could be no ques- 
tion of reversing that decision. The directors
are, as in every company, selected by the
board of directors, and their appointment is 
ratified by the shareholders at the general
meeting.</p>

<head>EGYPTIAN MINING ACTIVITY</head>
<p>In view of the existing activity in Egyptian Mining, the Directors of the London and Paris
Exchange have retalaed the services of a competitor Mining Engineer, whose reports n the
present position of the various properties is of the utmost importance. This Informa Ion is at
the disposal of Cheuta. Correspondents contemplating Investment in Egyptian Mining
Enterprises would be well advised in communicating with the Exchange before doing so, and
thus avoid the less of capital incurred by the purchase of worthless securities.</p>

<div type="item"><head>THE EGYPTIAN DELTA LIGHT
RAILWAYS, LIMITED.</head>
<head>A SATISFACTORY YEAR.</head>
<head>THE CAPITAL INCREASED.</head>
<p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyp-
tian Delta Light Railways, Limited, was held
at London on the 20th ulto. Sir A. Colvin
(chairman of the company) presiding.</p>
<p>The Secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) read the
notice convening the meeting.</p>
<p>The Chairman: Gentlemen, you will, I
presume, as usual, take the report as read. It
is with much pleasure that we place in your 
hands such a satisfactory account of the past 
year, the results achieved having been, as you 
will see, excellent. And this notwithstanding 
the fact that the cattle plaque prevailed
throughout the year, and that no mouleds or
religions fairs were held. Whilst the increased
average mileage worked has been less than
one-third per cent, the increase in the gross 
receipts has been £30,483 on a total of 
£132,791 for 1903, or 23 per cent. Towards
this our passenger traffic has contributed
£14,389—nearly one-half—the numbers carried
have gone up by 841,715 on a former total of
3,636,688, or nearly 23 per cent. The goods
traffic also was very good, the receipts having
gone up by £11,272, or over 20 per cent, the
tons lifted showing a very large increase of
274,167 tons on a former total of 471,530. But
of this 195,198 tons were for a special traffic in
earth for reclaiming land by filling. This is
entered under the head of “Manure," and ac-
counts for the very large apparent increase
under that head. The increase, therefore,
under goods proper is some 79,000 tons—say,
17 percent—there being an increase under
nearly every important item. There was a good
cotton crop, and we carried 25,326 tons
more, making a total of 136,375 tons of
cotton moved, mostly loose, on a total last
year of 111,049. The through bookings with
the Slate Railway is steadily increasing, and
this year amounted to 112,500 tons. The
stone traffic at the El-Mounir and Abou Zabel
quarries has made a fair start, and amounted
to 8,667 tons, and as the condition of the
country improves—the improvement year by
year is very notable—better houses will be
erected and more stone required for building
them, so that we look for a steady develop-
ment of this traffic to find employment for
our goods stock in the slack season. In some
very interesting articles in The Times last
year on American railways and their working,
it was stated that one of the principal
freight agents of an important American
system, on being asked what would be the
charges for the carriage of some 15-ton lots
a distance of 35 miles, replied :—"Oh, we
don’t worry ourselves about such business
as that We must carry most of our freight
an average of 50 miles at least before we
can consider that we have paid expenses
I would rather carry from ten to forty tons
of freight a distance of 1,500 miles for half
a cent per ton per mile than I would carry
it fifty miles for five cents per ton per mile.”
We think our staff, therefore, deserve credit
for the results achieved, when I tell you that
the average load of all our goods traffic is only
twelve miles with comparatively few consign-
ments as large as 15 tons. We had about
300 miles of telegraph open at the end of
the year, and earned £1,088, against an ex-
penditure of £479. There is not much money
in it, but it is a great convenience to our
customers and in train working. Sundries
also show a good increase of £4,610, due to
hire of rolling stock for construction purposes,
and to profits realised for the sale of reclaimed
land. As regards our working charges, whilst
the gross receipts have gone up by £30,483,
of this increase only £8,857 has been spent on
extra working, and this mainly on the addi-
tional train mileage entailed by the growth
of the passenger and goods traffic. This brings
our ratio of working down to the satisfactory
figure of 55.94 per cent against 62.12 last
year. We trust that the traffic will steadily
increase, and enable us to put this figure even
somewhat lower; but on the other hand, we
must remind you that as the line grows older
the charges for maintenance and renewal of
permanent way and rolling stock must increase.
Well, gentlemen, when after meeting
all charges for Debenture interest, putting by
the sum of £11,046 for the sinking fund,
and £2,834 for reserve, or a total ol
£13,880, equivalent to 1.8 per cent on the
Preference capital—although a considerable
portion of that capital was unproductive
owing to delays in getting sanction for works,
in obtaining possession of land required, ant
other causes-we found that we had sufficient
to pay you a dividend of 5 per cent for the
year without any material reduction of the 
amount brought forward from last year, to say 
nothing of having an appreciable reserve in
hand, considering the short time we have been 
working, we thought that with favorable 
prospects for the current year before us we
were fully justified in recommending for your
approval that dividend.</p>
<p>Since the report was issued we have heard
that Government have given their consent to
the fusion of the Helouan Railway with that
owned by the Delta Company, which has now 
been taken over and worked by us. As pointed 
out in the report, the concession for the Cairo
Quarry lines has been completed, and we have
now started work on them. For the reasons
given in the report we have not during the 
year made as much progress as we could have 
wished with our extensions, having only opened
some 17 miles ; since September 30th 6 miles
more have been opened. The concession of the
Province of Menoufieh is still delayed, pending 
the completion, presumably, of Government 
formalities, although we have done what 
we could during the past year to bring 
the matter to a close. We have also, sur- 
veyed some 130 miles of line, and carried 
out some improvements in the way of 
better stations, conversion of flag stations
into permanent stations, lengthening of sidings,
and such-like work necessitated by the growth
of the traffic. Altogether we have expended
some £141,000, of which £47,611 has been
spent on rolling stock, we having put on the
line twelve now 6-wheeled coupled engines 
which take excellent loads, 25 new bogie coach
ing vehicles, 100 new bogie steel platform wag-
ons, and since the close of the year 25 new
bogie coaching vehicles and six more engines
have been completed and are ready to go. With
the growing extension and increasing traffic we
must keep the line well supplied with stock,
and more will be required immediately. Your ,
board is greatly indebted to the exertions and
intelligent conduct of their affairs by their staff
in Egypt,to all of whom, and especially to their
agent. Captain Adams, RE., the acknowledg-
ments of the company are largely due. I am 
glad to be able to add that throughout the year
we have continued to maintain our customary
excellent relations with the Egyptian Govern-
ment authorities. I may mention that the ma-
naging director and myself hope to be able to
visit Egypt again this winter, to discuss various
important points with the local board and the
Government, and I trust our visits will con-
tinue to be of the same use and advantage to
the company as I venture to believe has hitherto
shown itself the case, both as regards the Govern- 
ment and as enabling us personally to discuss
with the local board, questions which require dis- ,
cussion on the spot, and of which the disposal is 
facilitated by such a direct exchange of views
between your directors. With your permission
I propose to deal first with the ordinary busi-
ness of the meeting, and when that is disposed 
of to bring before you proposals for an increase 
of capital. I will, therefore, now move :— 
“That the report of the directors, dated
November 30th, 1904, together with the state- ,
ment of accounts and balance-sheet for the
year ended September 30th, 1904, be and they
are hereby approved, confirmed and adopted.”
Before putting the resolution to the vote I
shall be very glad to answer any question that
shareholders may wish to put to me, or give
any information in my power.</p>
<p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the
resolution.</p>
<p>No questions bring asked, the resolution
was put to the meeting and carried unan-
imously.</p>
<p>The Chairman : Tho second resolution I
have the honor to propose is : “That the
interim dividend paid in June, 1904, be con-
firmed, and that a dividend at the rate of 6
per cent per annum for the half-year ended
September 30th, 1904, on the Preference
share capital of the company be and here-
by is declared to be paid to the share
holders of the Preference shares standing
on the registers of the company at Decem-
ber 20th, 1904, and the holders of Preference
share warrants to bearer."</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel R L. Marryat, R E
(managing director), seconded the resolution,
and it was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle moved, “That
Sir Auckland Colvin, one of the directors retir-
ing in order of rotation, be re-elected"</p>
<p>This was seconded by Sir Francis L. O’Calla-
ghan and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>he Chairman then moved the re-election of
the Hon. Sir C. W- Fremantle, and, this having
been seconded by Mr. Robert Miller, was
carried unanimously.</p>
<p>On the motion of the Chairman, seconded
by Mr. Montagu Sharpe, Maurice Cattaui Bey
was also re-elected a director. </p>
<p>Mr. Alfred Wilkins moved the reappoint-
ment of Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith and
Co as auditors.</p>
<p>Mr Benjamin Keable seconded the resolu-
tion, and it was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The Chairman : Gentlemen, I have now to
bring before you our proposals for the increase
of capital, the resolutions concerning which
you will have seen on the hack of the report.
We are not in immediate want of cash, as we
probably have sufficient to carry us on for
some months, but have come to the end of our
powers of issue, and we desire to be in a posi-
tion to be able to issue more capital as we
require it, and to take advantage of a favorable
money market, for, as you must be aware, that
market of late years has not always been very
favorable to fresh issues of capital. We there-
fore ask you to create 39,460 new Preference
shares, it being understood that we do not
propose to issue the whole of this amount at
once, as this would form far too heavy a strain
on our current revenue, but only such amounts
as we require from time to time and can
reasonably expect to earn interest on without
seriously affecting your dividends in any par-
ticular year. I will, therefore, now move:— 
“That the capital of tho company be increased
by the creation of 39,460 now Preference shares 
of the nominal amount of £10 each, and that 
such Preference shares be issued and allotted
by the board upon such terms and conditions
as they may determine, but such shares shall
be issued upon the terms (subject to the
powers of the board under Article 166 to set
aside sinking funds and otherwise) that the 
surplus profits in each year after providing
for a dividend on the amounts from time
to time paid, or credited as paid, otherwise 
than in advance on all Preference shares 
at the rate of 5$ per cent for each year,
shall be applied, first, in making up the
arrears of dividend on the Preference shares 
of the company previously issued in respect of
the period previous to the date of issue of the
new Preference shares hereby authorised, and
when those arrears have been paid, then in
paying up the arrears (if any) which may sub-
sequently accrue on all Preference shares in 
the order in which such arrears may have
accrued, and thereafter the sum of 10s 9d per
cent per annum on the said £394,600 of new 
capital as part of the sinking fund heretofore 
authorised in respect of the previous capital, 
so as to insure the repayment of the whole of
the share capital authorised up to the date 
hereof in its due order of priority under the
articles. Save as aforesaid, the said new 
Preference shares shall rank in all respects 
with the existing Preference shares of the
company."	</p>
<p>Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolu-
tion, and it was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>A shareholder asked if the chairman had
anything to say with regard to the land com- 
pany as it affected this company.</p>
<p>The Chairman : The land company is still in
an early stage. I think all that is to be said
about it at present is that it is in the stage of
inquiry and initial proceedings, but as far as
we can see at present things are going on very 
favorably, and quite up to any expectations
we could have. (Applause).</p>
<p>A vote of thanks was passed to the chair-
man on the motion of Mr. J. H. Busby,
seconded by Mr. Wilkins, and the proceedings
terminated.</p></div>

<head>RACING.</head>
<head>HELOUAN FIRST WINTER MEETING.</head>
<p>We congratulate the Helouan Sporting Club
on the success of the races held on Saturday
afternoon. Some of the causes which contribut-
ed to their success—the weather, for example,
and the air—could not, it is true, be assigned
to the activity of the committee, but in all
that concerned the arrangements on the course
we noticed an enormous improvement on last
year. The pari-mutuel is now behind the grand-
stand, which bus been properly roofed and
fitted up. The arrangements for supplying
tea were capital, and the races began and
ended as punctually as possible. There were
many residents and visitors at the races ; we
noticed among them H.H. Prince Mohamed
Ibrahim, General Lance, C.B., Coles Pasha,
Ishak Bey Hussein, Mr. Astley Friend, Saleh
Bey Yaghen, Mr. Carter Wilson, Mr. Webb,
Judge and Mrs. Satow, Capt. Herbert, Dr. and
Mrs. Nolan, Dr. Bentley, Mr. Monteith-
Smith, Mr. Aspinall, Major Davidson, Ibrahim
Bey Cherif, Ahmed Bey Bakri Mr. Lockett,
Ariz Pasha Izzet, Mr. Michaelides, and many
others.</p>
<p>The chief feature of the racing was the
success of Moharrem Pasha Chehin’s horses :
two firsts, a second, and a third was a good
record, and in the Sahara Stakes Bibico’s win
was a very easy affair, and Aeolus was only
caught in the last 100 yards by Kobelon
Tair. The fourth race was a long way the best
of the day, and Mizzaud lasting very well
beat Shewiman, the favorite, by a little. In
the fifth race Fil do Fer was a rather unex-
pected winner. Roland’s effort in the third
race was a little too late ; a hundred and fifty
yards more, and he would probably have been
third, it may be second.</p>
<p>CRITERION STAKES : of P.T. 2,500, 1st

<p>Togo gave a great deal of trouble at the
start, going some half-a-mile up the course be-
fore the flag fell. When the horses at last
were ready the start was poor. Sayad II. and
Togo led, but after the cutting Macdonald
came up, only to give way to Rainbow, who
passed Togo but could get nowhere near
Sayad II., who won anyhow. Togo was third
by 3/4 of a length. Time 1.27.</p>

<p>Firefly, which, with Roland, was a warm

Bibico and Aeolus were ahead and simply
riding away from the rest, who followed 4 or 5
lengths behind in a bunch. In the straight
Sattam and Roland rushed up, and the
former going very hard caught Aeolus and
was second by half a length, Bibico winning
without any undue exertion. Roland kept his
effort till too late but was going very well at
the finish.</p>

<p>After a moderate start Showiman led but
Mizzaud and Royalist challenged him and at
the first time round it was anyone’s race. Se-
cond time round Mizzaud passed Royalist, all
three horses still together but had to give way
to Shewimon, who looked like winning on
emerging from the cutting. Then came a splen-
did race all the way home. Mizzaud came gra-
dually up, got ahead in the straight and just
got home by half a-length. Royalist was a good
third but his jockey used whip too early.</p>
<p>Totalisator paid P.T.94 on winner, P.T.61
for place.</p>
<p>This race was followed by what appeared to
be a private and informal sparring display
between two well-known Egyptian owners of
racing stables, which was not visible from the
grand-stand.</p>
