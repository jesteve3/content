<head>PORT ARTHUR.</head>
<p> The fall oi Port Arthur brings to a close
the first greet phase of the war in the
Par East, a phase that has been prolonged
beyond all calculations by Stoessel’s obstinate
and heroic resistance. The temptation to
moralise is almost irresistible. The ignomi-
nious end of the great squadron of the Pacific,
the gradual crumbling of tho almost im-
pregnable fortifications are in themselves
both a sermon on the vanity of human wishes,
and an illustration of what foresight and
organisation can achieve when united to
discipline, to oourage, and to patriotism. But
the practical and strategical lemons to be
learnednom this long siege ere of even greater
interest to us as a maritime Power, and they
deserve to be studied the more caretully be-
cause of th' erroneous deductions to which
the catastrophe of Port Arthur may give rise.
Because the valour of the Kussian soldiers
sad sailors has been in vain, and because the
Russian Empire has suffered a humiliation to
which the capture of Sebastopol was as nothing,
it has been suggested by some authorities, end
especially by the military correspondent of the
Times, that fortifications are themselves a
delusion and a snare, that the harbour of Port
Arthur has been like a fatal magnet to the
ships of the squadron, and that Kuropstkin
should have begun his campaign by withdraw-
ing every man and every movable gun from
the Liao-tang Peninsula. In other words,
Port Arthur is claimed to have been what
Metz actually was, and what Ladysmith nearly
became—a fatal entanglement, engulfing its
own garrison, and finally compromising the
forces outside oi it by robbing them of the
power of initiative. Had Stdessel got the gar-
rison away while the railway was unout, had
Stark or Makaroff sailed off with the remnants
of their fleet, the abandonment of Port Arthur
itself; the enormous lost ot material, and the
blow to Russian prestige, would have been
more than compensated for by the freedom
which it would have given to Kuropatkin from
his first arrival on the scene.</p>
<p> Such an inference and such a teaching are,
in our judgment, not only wrong, but highly
dangerous, as tending to discredit the value of
naval bases end garrisons to a maritime Power
alike in peace and in war. They ignore the faot
that the misfortunes of the Russian Fleet have
been due solely and entirely to its own in-
efficiency and to the incapacity of those who
directed its movements. The ruin dates from
the first night of the war, when the Japanese
torpedo-boats were allowed to work their will,
end it was oompleted by the reluotanoe and
inability of the blockaded squadron to give
battle to the adversary in open water. If the
Russian Fleet had been bandied as the fleet
of a first-class Power ought to be, and as every
country has a right to expect from its naval
officers, Port Arthur would have been an
absolutely invaluable asset to Russia during
the war, and the march of the Japanese
armies on Manchuria would have been
definitely delayed. A glance at the map shows
that Port Arthur is an ideal “point d’appui"
for any nation at war with Japan; and its
importance can best be realised by the pro-
digious sacrifices which the latter Power has
undergone during the process of reducing it.
Nor does it seem to be realised how much
the prolongation of the siege has actually
affected the course of the campaign ; to
say nothing of the fearful loss of men, which
will be felt more and more as the war drags,
it deprived the Japanese of the superiority in
numbers which would have turned the battle
of Liao-yang into another Leipaic. And it has
so absolutely absorbed the energies of Admiral
Togo that he has been unable-to spare a single
ship from his fleet of observation, even when
the cruisers of Skrydloff were ravaging in the
home waters of Japan. Had the Baltic Fleet
been able to sail in the early summer, as
Captain Mahan anticipated, the Japanese com-
mander would have found himself in the
presence of a dilemma which might well have
proved fatal.</p>
<p> Indeed, the supreme importance of a well-
fortified and well-garrisoned naval base has
never been so dearly indicated, unless we go
beck to the siege of Gibraltar in 1779-83.
And the conclusion to ourselves ought to be
irresistible. Our own naval bases, to say
nothing of minor ooaling stations, are scattered
over every see, and their retention at all ooists
is the prioe of our existence as a naval Power.
Gibraltar, Malta, Siqaimanlt, Halifax, Ber-
muda, Singapore, Houg Kong, not to mention
others, have each their own port to play in
any scheme of Imperial defence. They do not
all require the same sort of protection. Ber-
muda, for instanoe, surrounded by its shoal
water, and guarded by its mine-fields, needs a 
garrison rather then big guns. Halifax, with
its rampart of the Atlantic surges, is practio-
ally immune from a torpedo flotilla. But they
all have to be defended, if we are to retain the
power of sending our fleets securely from one
part of the globe to another, and it is essential
that, one and all, they must be able to guard
themselves and their priceless stores of coal
and material without dependence on the Fleet.</p>

            <p>General Stoessel wrote yesterday to General
            Nogi saying that all further resistance was
            useless and asked to capitulate.</p>
            <p>The Russian and Japanese negotiators met
            at noon and separated at 4 o'clock.</p>
            <p>The Russians accept the conditions proposed.</p>
            <p>Hostilities are suspended.</p>
            <p>The Russians blew up several forts and ships

            <p>The capitulation of Port Arthur is causing
            great enthusiasm.</p>

            <p>Tokio, January 2.</p>
            <p>General Nogi informed General Stoessel that
            he agreed to appoint negotiators provided that
            the commissioners on both sides have full
            powers to sign an immediate capitulation.
            Meanwhile, hostilities have been suspended.</p>
            <p>(Later). The negotiations lasted from noon
            until 4.30 p.m. Arrangements have been con-
            cluded to sign an act of capitulation. The
            Japanese terms have been accepted.</p>

            <p>London, January 2.</p>
            <p>The concensus of opinion in diplomatic
            circles is that the fall of Port Arthur will only
            be a fresh incentive to renew the struggle more '
            vigorously. Russia will not spare any efforts
            to recapture it, or compel its submission in-
            directly. The only reservation in this opinion
            is the internal condition of Russia, which is
            the dominant factor of the situation. (R.)</p></div>

            obstructions have recently been modified

            <p>Amateur Theatricals.—The performance in
            Cairo of “The Pirates of Penzance” has been
            postponed, owing to the temporary absence of
            Lieut. Franklin, the musical director, in Khar-
            toum-. It will now probably take place about
            the third week in February. The respite is ap-
            preciated by the members of the troupe, as it
            was felt that the time allotted to the rehear-
            sals in the first instance was somewhat short.
            The delay will afford Major Delavoye more
            scope for the development of stage effects, and
            the performance will thus be as finished from a
            dramatic as from a musical point of view—a
            requirement not always sufficiently considered
            in the representation of comic operas by

            to leave Egypt to take up an important

            <p>The event of the Fall semester closing
            exercises of Assiout Training College was the
            contest between the Forum and Kiddonian
            Literary Societies. The representatives of the
            two societies, elected some months ago, contest-
            ed for honors in declamation, oration, and
            debate. The Kiddonian society won the oration
            and the debate, giving them five points out of
            six. The subjects of the two orations were
            “The Power of Oratory" and “Woman’s Power
            and Influence." 'The question for debate was
            “Resolved, that a final victory for Japan would
            be more beneficial to the world than a final
            victory for Russia.”</p>
            <p>A feature of the occasion was the music,
            vocal and instrumental, furnished by local
            talent, assisted by Miss Dysart of Cairo. The
            singing of the college glee club was thoroughly
            enjoyed by all, and showed a great advance
            over anything the club has given in public
            heretofore. </p>
            <p> A large number of the English-speaking
            community of Assiout were present,as the exercises
            were all in English. Every one was ready to
            congratulate the two societies and the college
            upon the great improvement in composition and style
            and delivery which was shown by the contest, since
            the orations and debate were entirely original
            productions by the students, with practically no changes
            made by the teachers. The two societies meet regularly
            each week, the results of careful drill and experience
            were quite manifest.</p>
            <p> The college has enjoyed a very prosperous session,
            with an attendance of 550 students. A large new dining-
            room is being erected for the better accommodation
            of the boarding department. The staff of instructors now
            numbers twenty-three regular teachers, even of whom
            are Americans. A valuable addition to the corps was made
            this Fall, in the college savings secured Miss Strutters,
            recently of Boston, for instruction in art and penmanship,
            and Miss Moore, of Pennsylvania, as matron. </p></div>

            figures for the corresponding period in 1903.
            The exports for November amounted to L.E.

            November lest year. This falling off is mainly
            to cotton exports, which decreased to value to
            the extent of LE 284,589, and cotton seed
            exports, which decreased by LE 76,482 com-
            pared with the figures for the previous

            <div type="item"> <head>EGYPTIAN GOLD DEMAND.</head>
            <p>The Statist understands that the Egyptian
            demand for gold is practically satisfied, which
            is entirely contrary to the general anticipa-
            tion. For some years past Egypt has been
            taking larger and larger amounts, and has
            been sending back less and less. It was gene-
            rally supposed that she would do the same
            this past year. As a matter of fact, she has
            taken exceptionally little.</p>
            <p>The general explanation given is that
            Egyptian capitalists have been buying Egyp-
            tian bonds and Egyptian securities of all
            sorts in the London market upon a very large
            scale—upon so large a scale, in fact, that to
            all intents and purposes their purchases have
            counterbalanced the amount due to Egypt on
            account of her exports.</p>
            <p>If the explanation be correct, it is interest-
            ing from two points of view: firstly, from the
            evidence it affords of the growth of wealth in
            Egypt. In all countries which have debts held
            in large amounts abroad, the natives begin to
            buy back those debts as soon as they advance
            in prosperity. Egypt, apparently, is doing this
            now. In the second place, it relieves the London
            market from one drain for gold. True, gold
            shipments after the turn of the year will
            not cause as much inconvenience as they
            would have caused during the past two or
            three months. Still it is well that the demand
            for the metal for abroad should decline.</p></div>

            <p>It has been decided to have a liquidation
            “a l'amiable” to the case of the failure of Mr.
            Selim TawiL Messrs. Gorrs, Sofio, and Deb-
            bane have been appointed liquidators.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that the assets of Mr. Selim
            Tawil amount to LE 750,000 and the liabi-
            lities to LE 700,000. Even if this estimate
            is not correct it is thought that the liabilities
            will be sufficiently covered or even at the
            lowest estimate a dividend of 90 per cent, will
            be declared.</p></div>

            <p>There was a large house at the Zizinia on
            Saturday and again last night to witness the
            performance of Maestro Cilea’s new opera,
            which met with a huge success. Signs. Angelica
            Pandolfini's interpretation of the title role was
            one deserving of the highest commendation.
            Her singing and acting were imbued with a
            great degree of originality and intelligence, and
            her rendering of the death scene was admir-
            able. Signa. A. Pandolfinl was ably supported
            by Sig. Bravi, who mde an excellent Count
            de Saxe. Tho baritone Nani, in the role of
            Michonnet, also scored a distinct success. Sig.

            Sals, Foglia, and Rossini were also at their

            <div type="item"> <head>“STRIKE" AT THE VERDI
            DEPARTURE OF THE ARTISTES.</head>
            <p>The strike of the artistes of the Verdi
            Theatre, Cairo, has terminated to a most un-
            satisfactory manner the majority of the com-
            pany having announced their determination to
            return to Italy as soon as possible and
            having refused to accept the modified
            terms offered by the management. In our
            opinion, they have had every reason to feel
            aggrieved at their treatment both by the
            direction and the Cairo public. The company
            was a vary strong one, containing artistes of
            really superior quality to any we have recently
            heard at the Khedivial Opera House, but
            none the less they failed almost entirely to
            attract the steady attendance of the music
            loving public. Certain performances drew
            large audiences, but in the main the results
            were disappointing to the extreme.</p>
            <p>We attribute this to part to the want of
            sufficient advertisement, and to the methods
            of the ticket-office, which were not always
            as courteous as might be wished, but
            the blame lies mainly on the public, who
            were very ready to applaud a performance
            given last night for the benefit of the artistes
            who are leaving Egypt, bot never gave them
            that continued support which would have made
            their departure unnecessary. Last night's per-
            formance was very successful. It consisted of the
            3rd act of Aida, which was excellently perform-
            ed, acts from Traviata and Trovatore, the Danza
            delle Ore from Gioconda, and the fourth act of
            Otello. The artistes were all at their best and
            we must again express our regret at the debacle
            so excellent a company.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>KHEDIVIAL AGRICULTURAL
            SOCIETY</head>
            <p>The following correspondence passed between
            the Minister of Finance and the President of
            the Khedivial Agricultural Society with
            regard to the new constitution of the latter;-</p>
            <p>Sir,—Since the formation, to 1898, of the
            Khedivial Agricultural Society, in which the
            Government took an active part, the interest
            shown by all classes of the community to the
            agricultural development of the country has
            largely increased. The various measures adopt-
            ed by the society—such as the organization of
            shows, the distribution of seed and manure,
            and the publicity given to kindred subjects
            through the medium of the Society's journal-
            have given a stimulus to all matters relating
            to the cultivation of the soil. Egypt being
            essentially an agricultural country, the general
            welfare of the cultivator most always be an
            object of the utmost solicitude to the Govern-
            ment, which during recent years has continued
            to aid the Society both financially and otherwise.</p>
            <p>From time to time, the desirability of creat-
            ing a Ministry of Agriculture has been urged,
            but the Government is of opinion that, for the
            present at all events, greater benefits will
            result from an extension of the work of the
            Society on certain lines. The principal defect
            in the past has lain to the fact that the central
            administration of the Society and the culti-
            vators were not in touch. In considering any
            new scheme of development, this point is one
            which should receive serious attention.</p>
            <p>After a careful study of the existing Sta-
            tutes of the Society, the Government has
            drafted, for the consideration of members, s
            series of revised Statutes of which I have
            the honor to enclose a copy. This document
            will be found to indicate generally the changes
            which, in the opinion of the Government, it
            is advisable to introduce into the organization
            of the Society.</p>
            <p>It is suggested that, to accordance with
            Article 21 of the present Statutes, a gene-
            ral meeting of members of the Society should
            be convoked, and that the proposed changes
            should be submitted to them for approval.
            Should the Statutes be adopted either to their
            entirety or with such modifications as the So-
            ciety may consider desirable and as the Go-
            vernment may approve, the Government is
            prepared to still further increase the annual
            subvention now granted to the Society, to
            order that they may be put into force.</p>
            <p>It is proposed that the Moudirieh Delega-
            tions to which reference is made to Articles 13,
            14 and 15 of the amended Statutes, should be
            substituted for those now existing in the
            Moudirieh towns of Gharbieh, Sharkia and
            Minia. Competent Secretaries for other
            Moudiriehs are not at present available, but
            as opportunities occur a gradual extension will
            be made to this direction, and the Govern-
            ment will, if necessary, consider the advisability
            of proportionately increasing the subvention.
            In the meantime, the society may engage
            students who have obtained their diplomas
            from the School of Agriculture: and these
            gentlemen, being placed on the Society’s experi-
            mental farms, and allowed to participate in the
            general work, will, in the course of a year or
            so, become competent to act as Secretaries to
            additional Moudirieh Delegations.</p>
            <p>The extension thus given to the work of ths
            society will necessitate the appointment of an
            assistant to the present Secretary, as well as
            that of a paid Accountant in the office. To
            meet this increase of expenditure, as well as to
            provide for the three Moudirieh Delegations
            to which allusion is made above, the Govern-
            ment is prepared to grant a sum of LE 3,000
            annually to addition to the subvention now
            accorded.</p>
            <p>The question of the establishment of a
            Statistical bureau, for the collection of infor-
            motion relating to crop areas and general
            agricultural returns, to which the Society is
            greatly interested, is at present occupying the
            attention of the Government</p>
            <p>The Government will be glad to learn in due
            course the result of tho deliberations or mem-
            bers, in order that the proposed changes, if
            adopted, may be put into force from January
            1st, 1905.</p>
            <p>I am to add that the Government would
            view with pleasure the election of Your High-
            ness as President of the Society and also of the
            Executive and General Committees ; of HH.
            Prince Ibrahim Pasha Hilmy and of H.E. Riaz
            Pasha as Vice-Presidents of the General Com-
            mittee ; of H.E. Chawarby Pasha and Mr. Gib-
            son as Vice-Presidents, and of Mr. Carey as
            Assistant Vice-President of the Executive Com-
            mittee. The Government would suggest the
            nomination of Mr. G. P. Fosden, the present
            Secretary of the society, as Secretary General</p>

            <p>(Translation).</p>
            <p>Excellency,</p>
            <p>I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of
            your letter No. 841, dated 23rd November,
            1904, containing the changes which the Go-
            vernment deems advisable to introduce into
            the Administration of the Society. This letter,
            together with the proposed new Statutes of
            the Society which accompanied it, formed the
            subject of deliberation at a meeting of our
            General Committee held under my presidency
            on December 3rd last The changes proposed
            were received with great satisfaction by the
            Society, and the Statutes, with the exception
            of one or two minor changes which the society
            thinks will render them more perfect, and
            which, under cover and separate letter I have
            communicated to your Excellency for considera-
            tion by the Government, were unanimously
            adopted.</p>
            <p>In accordance with the request contained to
            your Excellency’s letter, and in conformity with
            Art 21 of the existing Statutes of the Society,
            a general meeting of members was held on
            December 6th last at which the members
            cordially approved of the changes proposed
            and confirmed the decisions taken by the Com-
            mittee of the Society at its meeting of the 3rd
            inst. The society feels assured that the steps
            taken by the government to increase its sphere
            of usefulness will result in a  much greater
            interest being taken in its work by agricultur-
            its generally. Through the medium of the
            proposed Moudirieh Delegations, the steps
            taken by the society to aid cultivators in a
            practical manner will receive greater publicity
            and the society feels assured that greater ad-
            vantage will be taken of them. </p>
            <p>The members of the society view with great
            pleasure the continued interest which the
            Government takes in its work, and it is a great
            pleasure for me, as president of the society,
            to be the interpreter of the cordial votes and
            thanks which were passed at the meetings over
            which I had the honor to preside.</p>
