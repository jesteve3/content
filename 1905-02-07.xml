<head>MR. LEES BELLICOSE SPEECH</head>
<head>SENSATION IN GERMANY</head>
<p>London, February G.
Mr. Lees speech, mentioned in yesterdays
telegram, has caused a sensation in Germany.
The papers are angrily demanding an explanation.
Some of them declare that Germany will
now Work with redoubled energy in order to
increase her sea power.</p>
<p>.Mr. Lees now writes that he was incorrectly
reported, and that what he said was that we
must assume all naval powers to be possible
enemies. Owing to the growth of. such naval
powers, our possible enemies are more numerous
than hitherto, and, consequently, we have
to keep an anxious eye not only on the Medi-
terranean but also on the North Sea.
The "Standard" learns from Berlin that,
unless Lord Lansdowne promptly repudiates
the speech, Germany will ask for an explanation-</p>

    are at present convinced of the Russians
    good faith with reference to the presence of the

<head>LORD CROMER’S TRIP.</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent.)
Medinet el-Fayoum, Sunday.
Lord Cromer's speech here yesterday has
made a very good impression, and his strongly-
worded criticism on the growth of drinking
habits has been taken to heart. Many of the
omdehs who were among Lord Cromer’s au-
dience, were so impressed that they have told
me that they intend to petition the Govern-
ment against the manner in which liquor shops
are being opened everywhere in the villages
without let or hindance. I intend to found a
local society hero to combat the alcohofic habit
among the natives.
Lord and Lady Cromer and Lady Betrice
Thynne paid a visit to one of the native
kuttabs hero which is under the care of the
Ministry of Public Instruction
They also visited the native Sefa Coulop
rohoof. Della Bey, French consular agent here,
and the members of the schoof committee
recieved his lordship there.
the party took tea at the Moudir’s residence
and left at 3.15 pm for Wests.</p>
 <p>Lord and lady Cromer are expected to
 arrive at Beni Hasan this evening.
 We hear that Lord Cromer Is busily engaged
 on his annual report,</p> </div>

                <head>A CASE FOR ENQUIRY.</head>
                <p>A cairo correspondent writes:- to the west 
                    of Abdeen-square is a nasty quarter where few
                    sanitary and moral laws are enforced and 
                    where the grossest criminality prevails.  While
                    in that locality today I learned that
                    in a quarrel between an armenian and three 
                    natives the armenian was so badly beaten that
                    he, after a week or more, died, and nothing
                    has been done to assailate or murderers. 
                    In fact, the principal was pointed out to me,
                    and i was informed that a seargant of police
                    was bribed to strike this mans name off the book
                    for they all were arrested at the time of the 
                    quarrel.  I wish this matter to be inquired
                    into, for it is a most gross outrage if it is true
                    as i am led to believe it is.</p>

                    <head>PROF FELIX'S RECITAL</head>
                    <p>Professor Felix's concert took place at the 
                        Khedivial Hotel on Saturday night as an-
                        nounced, and considering the wet and tem-
                        pestous weather, was well attended. We must
                        congratulate the professor on his courage in
                        fixing a more modest price for the tickets than
                        is customary here for local artists, who ex-
                        pect their kind friends to pay the same price 
                        for the pleasure of bearing them perform as 
                        they would do for distinguished artistes from
                        Europe who can command audiences without 
                        the disagreeable touting system in vogue in
                        this country. Mr. Felix's selection of piece
                        was as it ought to have been, a happy one, as
                        his silvery touch was shown off to perfection
                        in most of them. If there was one piece
                        more than another that elicited enthusiastic
                        applause we might pick out an exquisite
                        Nocturne of Chopin's (Opus 15 No. 2), in
                        which an oft-recurring melody framed in flow
                        mg cadenzas brought ont the pianist's remark
                        able agility of finger. Wagner’s "Choeur des
                        Fileuses” from his "Vaissean Fantome”
                        arranged by Lizt, was also much appreciated.
                        Mr. Felix's wonderfully delicate touch is not
                        so well suited to the heavier German music,
                        which requires greater breadth of tone and a
                        deeper sentiment. To our mind his conception
                        of Mendelssohn’s "Fruhlings Lied” was quite
                        incorrect and far removed from the traditional
                        one as taught in German Conaervatories,but on
                        the other hand, the Duo by the same com-
                        poser was faultlessly played.
                        Professor Felix was ably supported by Mrs.
                        Frederick Cree, who sang, first, a romance by
                        Giordano from Andrea Chenier with great
                        refinement, and in the socond part Beetho-
                        ven's famous “Per Pieta.” Her passionate
                        rendering of the presto, “Ah crudel I” quite
                        carried away her audience, and on being encored
                        she repeated it with even more verve than
                        the first time. We must not omit the lovely
                        little duet by Missa, “Les Roseaux Chanteurs,"
                        charmingly suug by Mrs. Cree and Mme.
                        Felix, nor the instrumental trio performed
                        very ably by Mr. H. and Mr. L. Suzan accom
                        panied by Mr. Felix. Altogether a very plea-
                        sant concert, but we must suggest that another
                        time the pauses between the items should be
                        curtailed, and that a performer does not ussually
                        retire from the platform between two pieces
                        bracketed a and b. All praise to Mr. Lifonti
                        for the splendid Pleyel pianoforte lent for the

        <head>NOTES FROM SUAKIN</head>
        <head>H. M. S. Sealark Damaged.</head>
        <p>(From our Correspondent).
            Suakin, January 28.
            H. M. S. '‘Sealark’’ arrived here from Sheikh
            Barghont on the 14th inst in a damaged ion-
            dition, having struck a rock about 4 miles off
            Sheikh Barghout whilst surveying. She had to
            come into Suakin for the necessery repairs,
            which have now been carried, out with the aid
            of divers and material obtained from the
            Sudan Government Railways
            The "Sealark" after surveying here and
            at Sheikh Barghout, will probably go into dock
            and then continue her survey as far as
            Australia, which is her final destination.
            The British S.S. "Dart” arrived from Eng-
            land on the 14th inst. with a very largo con-
            signment of rails and fishplates for the Suakin-
            Atbara Railways
            The British S.S. "Thornley” arrived from
            England on the 16th inst, with a large consign-
            ment of iron sleepers for the railway.</p>

<p>The Khedlvial Opera House reasserted
itself in La Totea. The performance was in
every way excellent. Signora Pandolfini obtain-
ed and justified the welcome due to an old
Cairo favorite both by her singing and by her
acting. Signor Girand was pleasing and artistic,
and Signor Polese was conspicuous for the
excellence of his acting; we could wish: that
all opera singers would give as much attention
to details. "II Sagrestano" was amusing ;
and we should like to hear more of Sig-
nor Sala, the “timbre" of whose voice
has some charm. Staging and choris were
alike all that could be desired. We trust
that other performances will maintain this
level, and do away with the undoubtedly
bad impression caused by Rigoletto (amongst
Other pieces given). We would say one word
as to the orchestra. Though, it is certainly
composed of good musicians and directed by an 
efficient oonductor, there is often apparent a
certain want of judgment, which might well be
remedied, a lack of complete harmony with
the singers, This, in light opera, where the
melodies for the chief performers are the most
prominent part, may not be so harmful in
effect: but it is fatal in any such opera as
Tristan, or indeed in any piece where the
composer has devoted his attention to the
music and not only to these who execute it In
a word, we would wish to find (and we-have
a right to expect) that sense of ensemble
which it is the duty, as it should be the
pleasure, of the Khedlvial Opera Honse to</p>

<head>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE</head>
<head>LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR</head>
<p>Signora Isabella Sricher, the celebrated
operatic artiste, who created such a furore at
the Verdi Theatre in Cairo, and whose advent
bad been anxiously awaited by a large section
of the music-loving public, made her debut at
the Abbas helmy Theatre on Satdrday Even-
ing in Lucia di Lammermoor, and her magni-
ficent performance reached to the full the
highest expectations which had been formed
regarding her. To say that Signora Svicher
was admirable or excellent, would be but to
very mildly express the quality of her per
formapoe, from every point of view. Indeed,
we venture to say that never has Egypt before
been honored by the presence of two such
magnificent artistes as Signs. Gemma Bellin-
cioni and Sigus. Isabella Sricher, and from the
rapturous applause so lavishly bestowed by
enthusiastic and delighted audiences on each
of these accomplished ladies, it is oertain that
the season will be a successful one. Signa.
Svicher's Lucia, on Saturday, was an inter-
pretation such as is seldom seen. Her singing
was certainly a revelation to many present,
and herr acting was of a high order and showed
careful study of this mobt difficult rfllo. The
tenor, Signor Tomiaaui being unwell, the
role of Sir Edgard was sustained by Signor
Pagani, who scored a distinct success. In fact,
we think we have never heard Signor Pagani to
better advantage. Signor Baldelli, in the
small part of Raimondo, was excellent. The
other minor parts were in good hands and the
orchestra and chorus were fully up to their
 usual standard.</p>

                <head>ANDREA CHENIER.</head>
                <p>An admirable performance of Giordano’s
                    Andrea Chenier was given on Sunday night.
                    Signor Pagani was in splendid voice and gave
                    an excellent interpretation of the exceedingly
                    trying title role. He was the success of the
                    evening. Signora D. Bassich, who made her
                    debut on this oocasion, gave a fairly good
                    rendering of the part of Maddalens di.'Coigny,
                    but her voice is not robust enough to stand
                    her in good steed in an opera like Andrea
                    Chenier. As Carlo Gerard, the baritone Badini,
                    who possesses a voice of delightful freshness,
                    was eminently successful. Sig. Montanari also
                    scored a distinct success.</p>

                <head>RIGOLETTO</head>
                <p>Last night, a very excellent performance
                    of Rigoletto was given at the Abhas Theatre.
                    Excellent, we say, because in every respect
                    the “ensemble” was a matter for admiration
                    and, at times, even for Surprise. In Rigoletto
                    Verdi began to realise in a way which he
                    hitherto had not surmised, the important and
                    extensive powers of his mind Up to this
                    point he had written many tunes which had
                    been hummed and sung throughout the whole
                    world, but here he seemed to forego the 
                    enormous spirit of tune that was within
                    him, and to give himself up entirely to the
                    dramatic matter in hand. Last night's per
                    formance of the opera was eminently successful.
                    Signora Svicher, in the part of Gilda, was
                    from every point of view a very great success ;
                    her voice, which possesses some of the most
                    exquisite qualities of modern vocalisation, was
                    proved on this oocasion to possess an exquisite
                    and, if one may use the adjective in connection
                    with singing, a shining quality that impressed
                    one enormously, by reason of the absolute purity
                    of its evocation. Her range is enormous; she
                    never misses her effects, and, to sum up, we
                    regard her in no other light than that she
                    is dazzlingly brilliant She was frantically
                    applauded, especially after her delightful
                    rendering of “Caro noms,” which she was
                    obliged to repeat Sig. Tomisani took the part
                    of the Duke and enchanted everybody by the
                    magnificence of his singing. He is a tenor of
                    great power, and was in good form last
                    night, enthusiasm on the part of the
                    audience following everything he did. It stands
                    to reason therefore that his rendering of "La
                    Donna e mobile” waa triumphantly successful.
                    In the part of Rigoletto Signor Badini sang
                    excellently, though he did not impress us very
                    much with his acting. The other parts were in
                    good hands. The chorus was at times disappointing,
                    but on the whole good, while the orchestra 
                    deserves credit.
