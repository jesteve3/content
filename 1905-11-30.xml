                            polite, and well-educated. The young man

                        ACTION AGAINST THE KHEDIVE.</head>
                    <p>Sherriff Davidson in Glasgow issued an im-
                        portant judgment on the 21st inst., in an action
                        against the Khedive, who was sued for £2,000
                        by Mr. A. M. Gordon, naval architect and
                        engineer, of Baltic Chamberg Wellington-street,
                        Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>The action concerns the Khedive's steam
                        yacht Mahrousse, the plaintiff averring that he
                        was employed by the defendant in connection
                        with certain alterations to be made on the
                        yacht, and that he was to be paid £2,000 for
                        preparing plans and seeing the work carried
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Defendant states there were certain dealings
                        between plaintif and the captain of the yacht,
                        but he denied that plaintiff was employed to
                        do the work.</p>
                    <p>An interesting point in connection with the
                        case was that the yacht was arrested in the
                        yard of Messrs. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiss submitted an application asking
                        the court to apply to the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs for a certificate to the effect
                        that his Highness the Khedive was not an
                        independent Sovereign, and was, therefore,
                        subject to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
                    <p>The Sheriff refused this application, but
                        closed the record, and allowed a proof as to
                        plaintiff's averment that he has arrested the
                        property of the defendant to find jurisdiction.</p>

                        ANGLO-EGYPTIAN MEEETING.</head>
                    <p>The nineteenth ordinary general meeting of
                        the Englo-Egyptian Bank (limited) was held
                        yesterday week at 27, Clement's lane, E.C.,
                        Mr. Thomas Usborne presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the total net profit
                        exceeding £100,000. Although that constituted
                        a record, he warned the shareholders that
                        those records could not go on forever. For the
                        last fifteen years or so banking in Egypt had
                        been few, and no bad debts whatever had been
                        made on loans secured by Egyptian real pro-
                        perty. It was almost difficult to make bad debts
                        in a country where the land and other real
                        property were always rising in value and the
                        bulk of the people were getting daily richer,
                        but that position of affairs would reach its
                        zenith one day, and although he would not
                        have them attach too much importance to his
                        opinion, he though the zenith had been reach-
                        ed, and that the value of property was now too
                        high. There were now ten banks, the majority
                        of them important, at work in Egypt, and the
                        directors heard of another- an English one-
                        the prospectus of which would be issued very
                        shortly. The reserve fund was equal to the
                        paid-up capital, £500,000, there were other
                        small reserve funds amounting to £40,000,
                        and they were carrying forward £36,000. With
                        the consent of the shareholders the board
                        intended contributing £50,000 to a proposed
                        pension fund, and to add to it each year until
                        it amounted to £100,000, when they expected
                        the interest would meet the pensions. He
                        concluded by moving the adoption of the
                        report, which was seconded by Mr. H.A.
                        Richardson, and carried unanimously.</p>

                        week, before Mr. E.S. Grey, Official Receiver,
                        the first meeting of creditors was held
                        under the failure of Shrager Bros., merchants,
                        of 4 Lloyd's avennue, E.C.</p>
                    <p>The chairman repoted that the firm had
                        carried on business at Calcutta, Colombo,
                        Singapore, Alexandria, and Broome, West
                        Australia. The business was established in
                        1888 and the turnover had amounted to three
                        of four millions of pounds a year. Proofs
                        amounting to £57,809 had been sent in, but he
                        (the Official Receiver) was unable to state the
                        exact amount of the indebtedness or assets
                        until accounts had been received from the
                        various foreign branches of the business. The
                        London house acted as buying and selling
                        agents for the other branches, the principal

                        oil, rice, bone-meal, and shellac. The failure
                        was caused by the apparent excellence of this
                        year's jute crop. The London house received
                        large orders from Calcutta to sell for an

                        and the disorganisation of railway traffic,
                        Calcutta could not get delivery of jute, and
                        prices rose everywhere. The Official Assignee
                        of Bengal was in possession fo the Indian

                    <p>Two native women and six girls were
                        engaged in gathering snails on Tuesday after-

                        horrified to find the dead body of a man lying
                        on the ground. The man had evidently been
                        strangled. His hands were tied behind his
                        back, and a blue silk handkerchief was
                        firmly fastened round his neck.</p>

                        of about 30 dollars was found on his body by
                        the police.</p>
                    <p>Several arrests on suspicion have been made,

                            the mine in the mountains. After a fight
                            the attacking party succeeded in obtaining
                            possession of the property and camels, and
                            the men in charge returned and informed the

                        <p>Steps were immediately taken for the arrest
                            of the thieves, and men were stationed at
                            every outlet from the mountain. After two

                        santly all through the hot, damp summer and
                        autumn, and great credit is due to both pro-
                        fessors and pupils for the successful issue of
                        their arduous studies. When one considers
                        the small pittance received by the masters per
                        month, and the miserably small, stuffy rooms
                        at their disposal (which do not even belong to
                        them but are kindly lent by the University
                        committee), we can but feel astonished at the
                        amount of courage and patience that must
                        have been expended to attain such a result
                        The programme was replete with excellent and
                        interesting numbers, vocal and instrumental,
                        and the selections from Mozart's 'Requiem"
                        and Wagner's 'Apostle's Supper' were quite
                        surprisingly well given. The Financial Ad-
                        viser's note, which appeared on the after-
                        noon of the concert, was most opportune,
                        and gave great encouragement to the com-
                        mittee, Professor Colella, and his devoted
                        staff of professors, as also to the small
                        band of 50 adherents. There are "better
                        days coming" for the Conservatoire, and all
                        honor is due to those who have manfully
                        stuck to their guns in the days of distress and
                        opposition.</p>

                        <p>We have to chronicle a triplet of First Events.
                            The quiet and peaceful existence at Port
                            Sudan has been broken. We have had a 7,000-
                            ton ship at anchor in our quickly improv-
                            ing harbour, we have actually had a concert,
                            and, miabile dictu, prepared for a real cricket
                            match. It is true that some few days back,
                            we had an epidemic of bruglaries whcih upset
                            the monotony of life somewhat, and the
                            chance of capturing some enterprising burglar
                            sent one to the heated couch, with subdued
                            excitement and apprehension of all sorts of
                            contingencies, but Fielden Bey issued an
                            edict to the effect that after 9 p.m. (or
                            curfew hour) all people out in the highway
                            and byeways were to carry lamps, or suffer
                            such fines and penalties as he, the High
                            Official aforesaid, might impose, and Allah
                            is God, and Kismet is Fate. Lo__ the Faith-
                            ful no longer lose their property, and the
                            Feringhi High or unimportant, can once more
                            sleep the sleep of the hard worked and
                            just. Actually, the very room of the Majesty
                            of law and order (civil and military) was
                            entered, and a whole trunk of kit removed.
                            Luckily, the Inspector woke up, and the
                            enemy fled, pursued by a good six feet six
                            of solid English wrath, not to mention a rear
                            rank of a very angry Bey and sundry other
                            Government officers woken up from their
                            dreams of cool winds or English snows. So,
                            robberies having ceased, the arrival of a band
                            on the S.S. Afghanistan (Capt. Moore) was
                            promptly made use of, and an engagement as
                            promptly followed, and on the evening of the
                            15th inst. Fielded Bey and the members of
                            the engineers' mess at Government House
                            asked for the pleasure of the company of some
                            fifty of the residents, at a concert to be held on
                            that date (carriages at 10.30 p.m. might have
                            been added, but our first cariolet and swarthy
                            Jehu have yet to arrive) and The Residence
                            was very prettily decorated by the aid of
                            many flags known and unknown to students
                            of these national trophies, and kudos goes
                            to Messrs. Barry and Campbell, the artists
                            concerned. The orchestra, which deserves
                            mention, was quite a pleasant surprise, for
                            not only did they tackle a programme of
                            distinct class, but played the numbers with
                            well-drilled ensemble and evident respect to
                            the baton of their chef d'orchestre. Of a long
                            programme, the intermezzo of Cavalleria Rusti-
                            cana was delightfully played and well merited
                            the encore. Due appreciation of difference
                            between forte and piano was shown, and the
                            crescendos were distinctly not only weel done
                            but played with artistic enjoyment; other
                            successes were the rarely heard ballet music
                            from Gounod's Faust, Braga's Serenata (for
                            violincello and piano), an excellent violin
                            solo, and the pretty Salut d'Armour." The
                            concert terminated with the good old British
                            songs "The old Folks at Home" and "The Song
                            that Reached my Heart," arranged by the
                            conductor, the oboe and clarinet taking the
                            solos, and the pizzicato accompaniments being
                            dainty and effective. At the conclusion,
                            Fielden Bey was seen to congratulate Mr.
                            Coke on the work of his men. And they
                            deserved it. The audience of over 50 was
                            enthusiastic, even the placud Mohamedans
                            waking up to applaud each item. I ought to
                            mention that the orchestra is going out to
                            play at Bombay, at the new Taj Mahal Hotel 
                            there- a treat for its patrons.</p>
                        <p>The harbour works are progressing, and in
                            due time the quays will be ready to receive
                            some ten steamers alongside of them. New
                            houses, too, are springing up on all sides,
                            albeit there is no ground tenure as yet. Until
                            we get an hotel, and electric light, we shall
                            nto be happy.</p>
                        <p>A great disappointment occurred on the
                            18th inst. The town had challenged the S.S.
                            Afghanistan to play the first game of cricket
                            ever known here. Every preparation was 
                            made, a nice tent, iced drinks galore, and
                            hospitality in every shape were, at the hands
                            of our Sports Club, conspicuous. At the
                            last moment the captain of our opponents, Mr.
                            Coke, who is an old school and county player,
                            we heard, turned up to say that the ship was
                            due to sail at mid-day. The law of a ship
                            captain is like unto that of the Medes and
                            Persians, so we could but stand the musical
                            cricketer a cold doch an dorris and wish him
                            every luck in the Farther East.</p>
                        <p>A new firm has arrived, but this time it is
                            not a Greek one. The new arrival, Mr. Warren,
                            is an experienced African traveller, and he is a
                            genial fellow and full of anecdote, who should
