<div type="item"><head>COTTON’S NEW FOE.</head>

<head>A MYSTERIOUS WORM.
</head>
<p>Having been informed that some 300 feddans of cotton cultivation at Kafr Khadr, Tantah markaz, are being ravaged by a small green worm, which is not the Agrotia or But worm, and which does not appear to be the Bodenia Littoralium or ordinary cotton worm, Mr. Willcocks, the entomologist of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, proceeded this morning to Tantah from Cairo to visit the spot with the Moudir and diagnose the precise nature of the worm, which is attacking the leaves and not the root of the young plants.</p>
<p>In the meantime some 300 men and boys are busily engaged in picking the worm.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE LOCUST VISITATION.</head>

<p>The following note has been issued to the Moudirs of Beni-Souef, Asaiout, Minieb, and Assouan :—</p>
<p>"Locusts having been observed in your province, your most earnest attention is called to the necessity of awaking the liveliest interest on the part of the mamours and their subordinates, the omdehs,sheikhs and the whole of the population.</p>
<p>"Any necessary expenditure will be made on your own responsibility against the special credit already opened for the destruction of the cotton worm.</p>
<p>"The most important measure now is to see that each place on which the locusts have settled even for a short time is carefully observed and marked, so that a search may be instituted for eggs immediately.</p>
<p>“Inform every one that eggs collected and brought to a markaz or police port will be paid for at the rate of 100 milliemes per oke</p>
<p>“100 P.T. reward will be paid to every person who firs’, reports a spot where eggs have been laid.</p>
<p>“It must be clearly understood that the danger to the cultivation is not from the locusts which have now arrived, but from their young, which, it the eggs laid are not promptly destroyed, will be hatched in from 20 to 30 days’ time, and it must be remembered that each female locust lays nearly 300 eggs.</p>
<p>"You are requested to call the attention of your mamours to the decree of 16-6-1891, which must be rigidly applied as required, both for the purpose of searching for eggs, and later for the destruction of the young locusts.</p>
<p>“Attention is also called to the decree of 26 April last year, authorising moudirs and mamours to plough up any land on which eggs are deposited in sufficient numbers to constitute a public danger.</p>
<p>“This decree empowers the administrative authorities to make use of all persons, animal. and implements necessary for the purpose.</p>
<p>“Any crops which are already ripe should be cut first, and care must be taken, after ploughing, to harrow or otherwise break op the large clods of earth."</p></div>

<head>(From Our Correspondent.)</head>
<p>Luxor, Friday.</p>
<p>Since last I wrote you, the smallpox epidemic here has abated, and according to report there have been no new cases the last two days. Miss Gibson, of whom I wrote you last week, succumbed to the malady. The other Europeans that were attacked have recovered.</p>
<p>There was a serious accident between here and Armant yesterday. The axle of a truck of a goods train broke, through the truck being overladen, derailing seven tracks that were behind it, which all went to pieces. Fortunately there were no casualties, only one man, a mussaffer, was slightly injured. This accident would, however, have caused a serious hindrance to the traffic, but owing to the able management here, men and material were at once on the spot, and the line was soon cleared and repaired, with no delay whatever to the trains.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>PROPOSED NURSING HOME</head>

<p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
<p>Sir,—I quite agree with the leader as well as the letter re opening a Nursing Home in Alexandria, and I go so far as to say that it is a disgraceful thing that there should be four of these establishments in Cairo and not one here. Our English resident community is now very large and there are numbers of single men and single young women earning their bread in this city who, when ill, have to accept the shelter of foreign hospitals and also to be satisfied with the attendance either of foreign doctors or foreign nurses. But I see no practical suggestions have been made as to how to start such an institution, and for the very reason that those suggestions should proceed from the principal doctors of each community of Alexandria. I can well understand that the large European hospitals would greatly regret losing their ten-francs-a-day patients; but I cannot understand why the doctors should not hail with delight an arrangement which would certainly put more money into their pockets. If the leading medical men of our city would join hands, as was proposed by Drs. Mackie and Zancarri years ago, the Nursing Home would soon be established. Funds would be forthcoming for building and furnishing purposes, and such a home would of course be self-supporting if each doctor sent his private patients there instead of to the big hospitals. If Dr. Milton, after a very short sojourn in Cairo, was able to run a Nursing Home of his own, it seems to me absurd to say that there could be any possible difficulty in the way of starting such an establishment in Alexandria.—Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Pro Bono Publico.</p>

<div type="item"><head>ALEXANDRIA SCHOOLBOYS’ RACE</head>
<p>On Saturday morning,commencing at 6o'clock, a race was run from Sidi Gaber to Alexandria for one silver and two bronze medals. Ten boys entered for the race, all of them pupils of the Scotch School. Till the Sporting Club was reached the whole of the runners kept pretty well together,.but at this point Pace (14) took the lead, which he kept till he reached the Rond Point turning. Here he slowed up suddenly, and was soon overtaken by the brothers Benveniste, who had kept together all the way. Eventually, R Benvpoista (15) came in first, having covered the distance in 18 minutes. His elder brother(17), though rather exhausted, was not very far behind him, while about 30 yards separated the second and third.</p>
<p>Orfanelli took his ease till reaching Ibrehimieh, being the last but one to pass the Casino, then he began to put on speed. At the comer of Rosetta-road be caught up Kasheer (15),having then three others in front of him. Little by little he lessened the distance between himself and Pace (14) and, passing him, finished third. Had the race been a little longer he would probably have won. Of the ten competitors, five finished Within 20 minutes, via, R Benveniste, J. Benveniste, A Orfanelli, Pace, and Kasheer. This is good running when we consider the distance, and that all the competitors were mere boys.</p>
<p>It is proposed to have another race in about three months' time, but the plan and exact date are not yet fixed.</p></div>
