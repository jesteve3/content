            <head>NEWS NOT KNOWN IN RUSSIA.</head>
            <p>Port Arthur, January 3.</p>
            <p>The capitulation of the town was signed at
            9.45 yesterday evening.</p>
            <p>(Reuter.)</p>
            <p>St. Petersburg, January 3.</p>
            <p>The fall of Port Arthur is unknown to the
            general public. It has hitherto only been
            known to the official world, and to certain
            restricted private circles.</p>
            <p>(Reuter.)</p>
            <p>Chi-Fu, January 3.</p>
            <p>In the conditions of the capitulation of Port
            Arthur, it is stipulated that the officers of the
            garrison will return to Russia on parole and
            the men will be sent to Japan as prisoners.</p>
            <p>(Havas.)</p>
            <p>Tokio, January 3.</p>
            <p>The Russian officers will be permitted to
            return to Russia on parole. They will retain
            their swords. The Japanese occupied a number
            of forts to-day.</p>
            <p>The Japanese are very annoyed at the
            destruction of the ships arid the despatching
            of destroyers after the oiler to surrender. The
            newspapers, in consequence of such action,
            demand that the garrison shall receive severe
            treatment. It appears, however, that the
            destruction, etc., occurred after a Council of
            War had decided upon surrender but consider-
            ably before the Commissioners met.</p>
            <p>(Reuter.)</p>
            <p>Chi-Fu, January 3.</p>
            <p>Three torpedo-launches have arrived from
            Port Arthur. There are now 7 Japanese
            destroyers in the harbour.</p>
            <p>(Reuter.)</p>
            <p>Tokio, January 3.</p>
            <p>Apparently all the Russian destroyers reach-
            ed Chi-Fu and Tsingtan safely. The Russians
            destroyed all the men-of-war, and wrecked the
            remaining forts, together with everything
            valuable.</p>

            <p>London, January 3.</p>
            <p>All the comments of Europe and America
            agree that the fall of Port Arthur will conclude
            a military drama without parallel in history,
            on account of the valour and achievements of
            the victors, and the heroism and devotion of
            the vanquished. It is thought that the war
            will continue unabated.</p>
            <p>The Standard states that the end has been
            worthy of that marvelous conflict between men
            who were equally matched as regards an
            inexhaustible resource of unflinching courage
            and un ailing endurance.</p>
            <p>The Morning Post says that the capture of
            the fortress is one of the finest feat of arms on
            record.</p>
            <p>The Daily Telegraph states that the attack,
            demanding appalling sacrifices, has crowned
            the victors with glory.</p>

            come from Ghizeh and Galioubieb, so that
            little effect is noticed.</p>

            <p>Double Murder for- P.T. 50.—The Keneh
            Native Court has passed sentence of death on
            one Hussein Darwish, of the village of Barak-
            ma, Keneh Markaz, who was found guilty of
            the murder of both his uncle and aunt. Some
            time ago he deposited with his victims the sum
            of P.T.50,for the return of which he had applied
            on more than one occasion. His uncle, being in
            poor circumstances, was unable to pay the
            money and always postponed the time for doing
            so. At last, when the man’s patience was ex-
            hausted, he took a knife, went to his uncle’s
            house, and murdered both him and his
            wife, afterwards confessing his guilt to the
            Parquet.</p>
            <p>St. Joseph’s Home, in the Moharrem Bey

            Mrs. Chataway, Countess de Zogheb, etc. The
            fine Christmas Tree was given by Mr. von
            Pitner. It was bedecked with innumerable
            toys and beautifully illuminated. The tree
            had been decorated by the ladies who organis-
            ed the fete. The delight of the children who
            are so well looked after at this excellent insti-
            tution was a treat to behold, and gave a well
            deserved pleasure to the lady patronesses,
            who had been at great pains to organise the
            fete for the children. The fete was in the
            first place due to the initiative of Mrs. G.
            Debbane, who was kindly assisted by the
            “Dames de l'Ouvroir des Mires Chretiennes”
            and by many young ladies of Alexandria.</p>

            death in London a few days ago of Mr. Charles
            H. Allen, F.R.G.S., who was for 19 years secre-
            tary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery
            Society, in his 81st year. Mr. Allen came of a
            Quaker stock. Throughout his life he showed
            special interest in the development of Africa.
            At first his attention was largely concentrated
            on Egypt, where the British Government had,
            recently undertaken great responsibilities. He
            received invaluable assistance from General
            Gordon in pressing for the abolition of slavery
            and the slave-trade throughout the Egyptian
            dominions; and seldom did General Gordon
            come to London without visiting Mr. Allen to
            discuss some plan for the liberation of the mil
            lions in the Dark Continent. A warm coadjutor
            was found from the first in Lord Cromer, who
            rendered splendid help, both by his general
            policy and also by promoting individual
            schemes such as the Home for Freed Woman
            Slaves in Cairo.</p></div>

            <p>The announcement that the Khedive has
            bestowed the grade of Grand Officer (2nd
            class)of the Order of the Medjidieh on his
            English private secretary will be received with
            great pleasure by the members of the British
            colony, among whom Brewster Bey counts
            many friends. The Bey has been 35 years in
            the service of the Egyptian Government,
            having entered the Customs Administration
            and Coastguard Service in 1870. In 1879 he
            was appointed Director of Customs at Suakin
            by the late General Gordon. This post he held
            till 1882, when he served in the Egyptian
            campaign on the Commissarist stall (medal
            and bronze star). He returned to Suakin in
            1883, and served under Baker Pasha in the
            Intelligence and Commissarist Department
            and was subsequently appointed by the late
            Admiral Sir W.. Hewitt as Sub Governor, in
            addition to his duties at the Customs. In 1884
            he was appointed Commander of the Imperial
            Order of the Medjidieh, and in the following
            year he was lent to the Intelligence Depart-
            ment by the Egyptian Government, and was
            attached to General Graham’s force. He was
            present at several actions and at the taking of
            Tamai, being mentioned in despatches. He
            remained in Suakin as Director of Customs
            until 1890, when he was transferred to the
            Coastguard Service at Alexandria as Secretary
            and Controller. In 1891 he was selected by
            the Khedive Mohamed Tewtik as his Private
            Secretary, and acts now in the same capacity
            to the present Khedive, his son. He already
            holds the rank of Bey of the first class, and is
            Commander of the Imperial Ottoman Orders of
            Osmanieh and Medjidieh, and Chevalier of the
            Francois Joseph Order.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>MOTORS IN CAIRO.</head>
            <p>The motor car is becoming, more and more
            one of the regular features of the traffic of the
            Capital, and it is satisfactory to note that the
            drivers are showing a reasonable regard for the
            convenience and safety of the public. There is
            one point, however, as to which it seems
            desirable to draw their attention. This is that
            the mere fact of their having a good clear
            stretch of road before them does not justify
            their driving at high speeds in narrow streets
            or near footpaths occupied by pedestrians. At
            any moment a tyre may burst, with the im-
            mediate consequence of whirling the car sud-
            denly round to the right or left, and plunging
            it into the midst of a crowd of passers-by with-
            out leaving these a chance of escape. Several
            fatal accidents have already occurred in Europe
            in this way.</p></div>
            <div type="item"> <head>SHOUBRA BRIDGE SUBWAY.</head>
            <p>The new subway under the railway, that
            was to have been opened for public use during
            last month, is still far from complete, and we
            shall in all probability be well on into the new
            year before it will, or indeed can, be opened,
            The roadway has been pierced and the side
            walls built, but the iron roofing has yet to be
            fixed and the approaches constructed, and this
            means no small amount of labor. That, when
            completed, it will prove a great relief to the
            foot traffic over the Shoubra Bridge there can
            be no doubt, but, if it is to be rendered really
            effective, it will have to be placed under
            constant supervision, both with regard to the
            uses it may be put to and for the prevention
            of obstructions and blocking. Very much of
            its utility will depend upon the approaches,
            as if these are not convoniently placed and
            arranged they will very largely discount the
            value of the accommodation the tunnel will
            afford.</p></div>

            <head>NOTE BY THIS GOVERNMENT.</head>
            <p>A Note has been issued by the Government
            of explaining its intentions in imposing the
            regulations of this year upon the pilgrimage.
            The Note points out that, so far from in any
            way exploiting the pilgrims for its own profit,
            it has to pay a considerable charge to the
            Khedivial Steamship Company, being obliged
            to guarantee a minimum number of pilgrim
            passengers in return for the reduction of their
            fare.</p>
            <p>The Government points out that the oscort
            of the Mahmal has been increased to 400 men,
            causing an additional expense of L.E. 5,000.
            The pilgrims, of whom 1,614 have expressed
            their desire to accompany tho Mahmal, will
            thus benefit by obtaining greater security and
            the best medical care that can be provided.</p></div>

            <p>Suez, Tuesday.—A few days ago, a native
            theatrical company came to Suez and erected
            in the centre of the town a wooden theatre
            covered with awnings. Last evening, at 7.30
            on the occasion of the first performance, a
            crowd of natives assembled at the theatre, but
            did not enjoy the play for very long, as a lamp
            set fire to the canvas and the whole place was
            in a very short time burnt to the ground.' A
            panic ensued amongst the spectators, but they
            all managed to escape uninjured. The Fire
            Brigade arrived on the scene promptly and
            rendered every assistance, but the engine
            could not be made use or as the firemen were
            unable to get up steam.</p></div>

            <p>On Thursday, 29th ult, a sumptuous tea
            and impromptu concert was given at the above
            club to the seamen in port. The rooms had
            been tastefully decorated for the occasion, and
            the tables were beautifully laid with large
            supplies of cake, sandwiches, and fruit. About
            40 seamen sat down to partake of the treat
            offered them. After the tea, which was served
            by lady, visitors, a concert followed, and the
            men cheerfully came forward to sing songs.
            During the concert cigars, cigarettes, sand-
            wiches, and refreshments were served, and the
            greatest cordiality and good feeling prevailed
            throughout, though the men were of divers
            nationalities, creeds, and color. The meeting
            broke up at 10p.m., all those present standing

            <p>The Pall Mall Gazette makes the following
            remarks on the interview which we reproduced
            from the Standard on Monday last:- If any-
            thing were needed to confirm the rumours ,
            afloat regarding the construction of an altern- ,
            ative canal between the Mediterranean and
            Red Sea, we should imagine the interview
            with M. Bonnet, the secretary of the Suez Canal
            Company, published in the Standard, would,
            sufficient. This gentleman denies nothing, but
            in the course of a columm of commonplace
            remarks he asserts that his company has a
            monopoly for seventy years to come. Such a
            statement will cause not a little surprise in
            London, and, we should imagine, to the shade
            Mr. Gladstone. To those behind the scenes
            Mn Bonnet’s ingenuousness is quite refreshing,
            for the leaders of the agitation for a new
            1anal are hard at work upon their scheme.
            How long will it be before Prince d’Arenberg
            follows the example of the late M. de Lesseps,
            who, after protesting that he would concede
            nothing, came to London to find out on what

            <p>A fatal quarrel took place yesterday after-

            of whom was a suitor for his own sister's
            hand. A discussion arose between the men
            and the murderer drew his knife and despatch-
            ed one at the brothers with a single stab. The
            other brother came to the rescue but received
            two stabs, to which he succumbed in the

            <p>The murderer is a young man, about 20
            years of age, and is extraordinarily muscular.
            His name is Yanni Antonio Stigrigo, and he

            Strong hopes are entertained that a find of
            considerable magnitude is about to be un-
            covered. Extensive subterranean galleries
            were excavated some years ago, but, owing to

            TRANSLATION.</head>
            <p>M. Maspero has published a new translation
            of the stele of Userkaf (the Usercheres of
            Manetho) of the fifth dynasty, found by Prof.
            Petrie at Abydos. He thinks that if Prof.
            Petrie's copyist had been, as he says, “a
            professional Egyptologist," he (or she) might
            have been ablo to make a guess at many of the
            mutilated signs, and thus have oonsidorahly
            reduced the lacuna in the copy from which we
            now have to work. He does not agree with Mr.
            Griffith in the view that the inscription was
            originally written on papyrus, and afterwards
            transferred to stone, and he corrects the
            translation published by the last-named in
            'Abydos IL' in several particulars. M. Maspero
            has also given a criticism of Dr. Erman’s recent
            ’Aegyptisches Glosaar,' in which he laments
            that Dr. Erman refers his readers in certain
            cases to his grammar only, and not to the texts
            on which it is supposed to be founded. As M
            Maspero says, it is necessary for beginners
            even more than for more advanced scholars
            that they should have an opportunity of check-
            ing for themselves the theories of the Berlin
            school, without being forced jurare in verbum
            magistri. Perhaps the sting of his criticism
            ies in the concluding words that the 'Gloasar'
            should prove useful to students at German
            universities and beginners in other countries.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>VERDI THEATRE DEBACLE.</head>
            <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—</p>
            <p>I see that the Verdi Theatre performances
            are few and far between at present, that ap-
            patently the company are losing over the ven-
            ture, in short, that they are likely enough to
            give it all up. It is the greatest possible pity.
            Here we have good, an excellent opera com-
            pany giving us just the repertoire which should
            appeal to us. The weary resident and the gay
            visitor do not usually want overmuch Wagner
            or the like ; they prefer these lighter operas,
            and yet no one seems to go. I admit that the
            Verdi Theatre has had one or two off-nights,
            viz, and to wit, Gioconda for one; but Mignon,
            Aida, Carmen, Otello, all were excellent. They
            have a surprisingly good orchestra. They have
            five or six leading players who are good enough
            for anything—Signora Monti-Baldini, Signor
            Tomisani, Signora Popovici—and I was told
            that Signora Svicher was very good. I have not
            been, I admit, to all the performances—by no
            means—but I have heard about those I did
            not see.</p>
            <p>I will say at once that the raison d'etre
            of this article is not personal in any sense;
            it is more an expression of my wish to tell
            Cairo people in general (so far as they take any
            notice of my valued criticism) that if they
            wish to see a good light opera oompany,
            they havo the chance and I wish they would
            take it. It is pitiful to see the house emptier
            and emptier, and the performers less and less
            enthusiastic or inclined to do their best And
            I should imagine it is certain enough that if
            this Company gives up this their first attempt
            we shall get little enough chance of any
            further repetitions. I admit the locality is
            annoying, but the swift Cairo cabs make
            this of little account. Once in a way it may
            be said by some that they-let us put it so—
            prefer the environment, internal as well as
            external, of the Khedivial Opera House, but
            they can always take a box. And really it
            was the sight of those many empty boxes
            which moved me, as could no free seats
            or first-night suppers or other induce-
            ments (which same I haven’t had), to cover
            two sheets of paper — that, and the wish
            to hear the operas myself, for, O well-
            beloved visitors and residents, if you don’t en-
            courage the opera, the opera will vanish, and
            I shall have to go without! Invade the boxes,
            then, ye visitors and we, “poor devils on a
            fixed income," will, lessen our supply of ciga-
            rettes, and set apart the piastres necessary for
            our postri numerati, blessing you in that our
            economy is not unrewarded</p></div>

            <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</head>
            <p>Sir,-was "Cariene's" object to drive my
            nails home, or stir up the dry bones in the
            almost forgotten valley of satire? Preeuming
            he latter, I pick up a bone here and there and
            offer you the “bouquet"</p>
            <p>Most decidedly,“Cairene,” the “philanthropic
            (why not philo-progenitive) labors" should
            have some “forthcoming,” and if the Anglo-
            American Hospital is to have the honor of
            presenting our dual community with fifteen
            new members “at one and the same time"
            more power to it (the hospital); long may
            it flourish (the hospital again); also the
            “fifteen at one and the same time" (A happy
            new year to them); also the thirty proud
            responsibilities (A happy new year to them
            too). But was it not as you infer, a little
            invidious to call upon the resident civilian
            community to share the responsibility and
            add another "embarrassment" fifteen of them
            to their “present financial" ones</p>
            <p>By all means “Cairene," agitate for State-
            aided lying-in hospitals, and impose penalties
            on those who do not make use of them, but
            why a private community, bachelors and bene-
            dicts alike, should be called upon. to “lay out”
            to the tune of fifteen ‘lying-in’’ embarrass-
            ments at a time, and which they had not bar-
            gained for, is just a little too much.</p>
            <p>And why, “Cairene,” do you laud and
            damn in the same breath the “recent opening
            of a similar establishment in Cairo,” when the
            “highest medical authorities have apparently
            fixed upen Ghezireh as the one and only site
            for an ideal fresh-air-lying-in-laying-out show.
            Come, come,—I mean “Go to” (no dash, Mr.
            Comp, please, I am quoting Shakespeare),

            <div type="item"> <head>VANDALISM AT CANOPUS</head>
            <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
            <p>Sir,—Your criticisms on the lack of initiative
            of the Alexandria Archaeological Society to
            reference to the state of affairs prevailing on
            the property of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun
            at Aboukir may be absolutely correct, but I
            should like to point out that the society suffers
            from a chronic impecuniosity, due to the fact
            that it is so poorly supported by the public of
            Alexandria. I use the phrase "chronic im-
            pecuniosity" in a comparative sense, for if the
            society's means were greater, it would indulge
            in far more extensive operations. Considering
            the grant that the Egyptian Government
            accords to the Museum Service, it is absurd
            that the Alexandria Archaeological Society
            should depend on private contributions.</p>
