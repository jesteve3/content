                    JUVENILE CRIMINALS.
                    Coles Pasha’s latest report contains much more detailed information regarding juvenile criminals than has previously been given. It appears that 2,461 boys got into trouble for contraventions last year of whom about half were whipped, and the rest imprisoned. They were for tho most part not Arab "hoolig-gans," but little shoeblacks without their badges, or were guilty of the heinous crime of leading about blind beggars in forbidden quarters. 'Assault’ is a term as often as not applied to a street son file or squabble, and most of the little thieves appear to be first offenders. It really seems that the police of some towns in Egypt devote an amount of attention to the exploits of small boys that is not justified by their criminality, The Cairo policeman of course makes the largest haul, but it is curious that comparatively small towns like Itai el Barood, Deshna, and Diknrni. should produce l42,69 and 51 oases of juvenile criminality respectively, while Mansonrah only boast. 34, and the large town of Mehalla el Kubra 15.
                    The Ministry of Justice has established a “Joveaile Court" in Ciin bifi.-j whuh an y youthful offndiri appear. Ai Ctlas t'aifu points oat, tin fait that the Goirt sita only onoeaweak is nit calcilatjl to j iitify tbs iofiiotioa by it of thi puiisbinir. or winp u i« a the obm of the offencess of 6 days out of the seven. Whin yon whip a boy, yen give b w bis pnaiihmai'. as so in aftsr his offence as possible and let h<m go, and the seventy of the punishment is esiased by its brevi y When yon keep, say, a badgelees bootblack f ir five days in gaol and then whip him—a sturdy shawish inflating the penalty—there is nothing to oonnterbalanoe the pain, which is bat tbe oalmination of an nnpleasant experience. It seems to m that imprisoning your jnvenile offender first, and than inflicting a fresh pun ishment (whioh is supposed to take the plaos ol imprisonment) on tbe nnfortanate little wretffi is a needless piece of oxaelty. Coles Pasha suggests that a special bureau dealing with jnvenile offenders should be organised, and a single member of tbe Parquet appointed to reoeive daily reports of oass of offenoes by children, and the number of children awaiting trial in prieon throughout tbe ooontry. Snob a measure would check tbe excessive zeal of tbe type of shawish, who is ready enough to blackmail an arbaghi, or to pounoe upon an annoying boot-black, but will not stop a ‘oarro’ manned by a sturdy carter, from backlog onto the pavement, or bestir himself after midnight to silence a roaring band of festive Berberins, wfcld prevent oarelessness cm tbe part of the Parquet, and would in a great measure remove the class of juveniles awaiting trial from the prisons. Bat whst is most required is a law providing for waifs an i strays. Gnat as is the charity of the Moslem poor, then an nambers of homeless little vagabonds who live—for no one will ever die of banger in Egypt—bat learn nothing and grow up nnder conditions that an bound to foster criminal tendencies.
                        
                        
                        LANCASHIRE'S COMING TROUBLE.
                        Judging from the despondent tone of the leading Lancashin papers, it appears only too likely that the cotton industry may be largely paralysed within a fortnight. As usual the cause is a suicidal quarrel between capital and labour, the operatives demanding a 5 per cent addition to the wage rate all round, while their employers contend that the present condition of business does not warrant any augmentation. This would look to be precisely the sort of issue suitable for arbitration, bat on neither side is any desire expressed for that method of settlement. Among the men, a suspicion exists that many of their employers would be rather glad than sorry to limit output, as the best way of connteraoting the renewed efforts of the American ring to create a speculative corner in the raw materiaL Its price has been lately poshed op almost to prohibitive level by those gamblers, and on the last occasion of the sort, it was found that the best remedy was the limitation of manufacturing production. The Lancashire mill owners also contend that the moderate profits they are now making go bat a little way towards wiping oat the enormous losses they suffered daring the cotton famine. The operatives urge,on the other hand, that they suffered even more through the loss of wages. Without weighing these conflicting arguments in comparative scales, we cannot too vehemently recommend both parties to accept arbitration, sooner than embark in hostilities beneficial only to their foreign competitors, and absolutely ruinous to the great British industry on whose prosperity their own wholly depends.
