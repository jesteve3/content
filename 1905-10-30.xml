								which spread to every trade and profession. There is practically no
								railway communication and there are no newspapers. Ordinary life is
								at a standstill, and all schools, colleges, and universities are
								closed. Moscow is absolutely cut off owing to the strike of the
								telegraphists. Odessa is also practically isolated. The town council
								is establishing a militia for the defence of the citizens. Reval is
								plunged in darkness and the theatre has been burned. The Minister of

					<head>THE ROYAL TOUR.</head>
					<head>RENOWN'S PORT SAID STAY.</head>
					<head>(From our Correspondent.)</head>
					<dateline><placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Saturday.</dateline>
					<p>Now that the Royal party have left us on the continuation of their Tour, it
						may be interesting to review the progress of the trip up to the time of
						their departure. H.M’s. battleship Renown left
							<placeName>Portsmouth</placeName> on Sunday, 15th inst, for Genoa, where
						the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q269412">Prince</persName>
						and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76927">Princess</persName>
						of Wales embarked. From Genoa to the Straits of Messina the Renown was
						accompanied by H.M.S. Lancaster, Suffolk, Terrible, and Cambrian, with
							<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q323773">Lord Chas.
							Beresford</persName> on board. Just as the Royal party were leaving
						Genoa the Italian Fleet rounded the point The fleet consisted of Sicilia,
						Marco Polo, Delfino, and other vessels. When the Renown and her escorts
						arrived in the Straits of Messina, they were met by the whole of the
						Mediterranean Fleet, consisting of H.M.S. Bulwark, Queen, Formidable,
						Implacable, Venerable, Irresistible, Sentinel, Prince of Wales, Goliath,
						Venus, 14 destroyers, and others. The actual place of meeting was off
							<placeName>Cape Pellaro</placeName>. The usual Royal salute was fired,
						after which manoeuvres began and lasted till sunset. Later in the evening
						there was a grand display of illuminations and fireworks. The fleet returned
						to Malta as soon as Reggio was passed, and the Terrible proceeded to Port
						Said at full speed, in order to have time to coal at Suez before the arrival
						of the Prince. It was expected that the Renown would arrive here at 8 a.m.
						on Friday, and as a matter of fact no one expected her on Thursday,until
						about 11 a.m., when Capt. Tottenham informed the British Consul that he had
						received a wireless telegraphic message from H.M.S. Suffolk saying they
						would arrive at 3 p in. The Renown, on her arrival, moored opposite the
						Canal Company’s office. The band of the Lancaster played "God bless the
						Prince of Wales" while the Renown was mooring, and immediately after the
						Renown's band struck up "God save the King." The Princess, who was on the
						bridge with the Prince, looked charming in a black skirt with a white bodice
						and yachting cap. Their Royal Highnesses remained on the bridge until the
						ship was moored and the boats returned. They then retired to their private
						rooms, and afterwards received some official visits. After the visitors had
						left the Renown, the Prince of Wales was to be seen strolling on deck
						conversing with the Captain Soon after 7 o’clock his Royal Highness retired,
						and most of the people who had been waiting on the shore, in the hope of
						seeing the Royal party land, left. Early on Friday morning the Prince and
						Princess, accompanied by some members of their suite, left the Renown and
						boarded the Surprise, where they took lunch. Afterwards, the Prince
						inspected the yacht and shortly after 3 p.m. he and the Princess proceeded
						to the Lancaster. Here the Prince inspected the ship and, as already
						reported, rang the silver bell which was presented to the vessel by the
						ladies of Lancaster. Subsequently the Royal party went on board the Suffolk.
						Tea was the chief item on the programme on the Suffolk. The stern of the
						ship was very prettily decorated with flags, etc. The Prince, on leaving,
						shook hands with all the officers, and the sailors gave three cheers for the
						Prince and Princess, and another three for the King, as the Royal Standard
						was Hauled down. From H. M. S. Suffolk the Prince and party went to the
						Powerful, where they were met by the captains of all four ships. Dinner was
						served later in the evening, after which a ball was held, and the Prince and
						Princess returned to the Renown soon after mid-night The Renown finished
						coaling about 2 p.m. yesterday and by 6 p.m. everything was as clean and

							£1,360 the feddan. This price was thought by the Wakfs Administration to
							be insufficient, and consequently it was decided to have a new
							adjudication. We hear that few companies were prepared to compete owing
							to certain drawbacks connected with this property, such, for instance,
							as the fact that all the river frontage, amounting to 14 feddans, had
							been sold by the heirs as private property to various persons, and
							consequently would not enter into the general sale. Another drawback was
							the fact that a portion of the property was understood to be leased for
							a period of seven and a half years and that under no circumstances would
							the lessee give it up to a purchaser until the expiration of his term.
							We now hear that the lessee has officially notified the Wakfs
							Administration of bis intention to hold his land for the entire period
							of his lease, although the administration only recognises his right to a
							part of it A good deal of discussion took place about this at the time
							of the first adjudication, as several important persons are said to be
							in interested in the matter, and the point is one that has an important
							bearing on the renewed sale of the lands, which has been fixed for the

							<head>BAD WEATHER IN THE HARBOUR</head>
							<head>(From our Correspondent).</head>
							<head>Port Said, Sunday. </head>
							<p>The last few days have seen a long of more or less serious accidents
								in the harbour of Port Said largely owing to the somewhat protracted
								spell of bad weather which we have experienced here. The night
								before the arrival of the Royal party in the Renown it blew hard
								from the east, and in a short space of time a sea got up which did
								considerable damage to the new East breakwater. Towards morning some
								30 yards of newly placed block of concrete had disappeared and a
								large hole had been breached by the sea in the small jetty. Some
								forty native craft, wind bound, laden with coal, took refuge under
								the lee of the jettes and one was sunk The Messageries Senegal
								hooked some mooring chains with her anchor and, drifting round,
								smashed he windlass, and divers lifting material were sent at
								daylight on Saturday to assist her. During the early hours of
								Saturday, a collier, the Appledore, to avoid a collision with some
								of the native vessels which at all times are to be seen crossing and
								tacking in the sea channels, let go both anchors and did so much
								damage to herself that she was obliged to slip both chains ; which
								chains and anchors it took over a day to recover and replace on
								board. The record was completed last night, when Bell’s Asia Minor
								steamer, the Bear, coming into port, in the main channel, ran into
								and sank a very large Arab dhow laden with some 100 tons of coal and
								carrying no lights — which, by the way, is after all not at all an
								uncommon state of affairs in the harbor and on the coast line of
								Port Said. The sound of the crash of torn and rending timber,
								accompanied, as it was, by the noise of falling spars and the howls
								and screams of the vessel’s crew and of those of many other similar
								vessels at anchor in the vicinity, was awe-inspiring and terrifying
								in the extreme. The Bear apparently went astern on the engines, for
								her rudder could clearly be seen from the breakwater in a mass of
								foam and spray, and a circle of some yards of churned-up water was
								remarked, by many among the witnesses of the collision, Which
								occurred at 8 p.m. The Canal Company's launches were in the Vicinity
								and very quickly had lines on to the sunken vessel endeavouring to
								tow her out of the channel, with little chances of success, for the
								dhow bad completely sank in a minute after the shock, which most
								have cut her nearly in two. I have heard that no lives were lost and
								that her entire crew of 16 were picked op almost immediately. The
								Bear, after examination, slowly proceeded to her berth, having
								suffered no apparent damage, and to-day shear-legs and divers are at
								work getting the sunken ship dear of the channel, which, however,
								remained dear on its western side.</p>

						<head>THE P18NI CASK</head>
						<head>FURTHER HEARING OF WITNESSES</head>
						<p>Pisani, the Malteese, was again brought before the British Consular Court
							both on Friday and Saturday, on the charge of having attempted to murder
							Victoria Dehan, and Austrian subject, at the Pension Krauss, on the 13th
							inst Mr. A. D. Alban presided, Mr. Favargi acted as registrar, and
							Maltre Sciortino appeared for accused. In giving evidence on Friday,
							Captain Arthur Quartier, inspector of the secret police, deposed that he
							was called to the Pension Krauss in the Old Zaptieh street on the 18th
							inst. and that on entering he found there a man who was connected with [
							] "Imperiale," an employe of the Telephone company, and the landlady. He
							was handed a revolver which he selt in order to convince himself that it
							had been fired recently and which he then put in his pocket. The mirror
							was broken and the carpet and two chairs were blood-stained. He found
							Victoria Dehan in the next room standing up and holding her right side
							from which blood was flowing. There was also a man in the room who
							proved to be Giorgio Mascarelli, the woman's lover. He took her to the
							Gards Medicale, where she was attended by a doctor. Shortly afterwards
							the Commandant of Police and the chief of the secret police arrived, and
							in their presence he unloaded the revolver, which contained two loaded
							and three empty cartridges. Accused came to the pension in te custody of
							the mamour of Mousky ceracol and witness examined his hands. He found
							the top right hand between the thumb and fore-finger discoloured, and
							there was a slight bruise on the fore-finger, the left hand was much
							discoloured and both smelt of gunpowder. Victoria Dehan, who had
							returned to the pension, was confronted with accused, who she identified
							as her assailant. VIncenza Zuixef, mother of the injured woman, was next
							called and said that she cae to Cairo to take her daughter back to Port
							Said, where her husband lived. She next accused at the railway station
							and afterwards went to the pension, having first visited the Hotel de la
							Poete. At the pension witnesses, Victoria Dehan, Pisani, and the
							landlady went into a parlour. Accused told Victoria that he had sent for
							her mother to take her back to Port Said. Victoria said she could not ge
							at present, and told accused to leave the room as she wished to speak to
							her mother. The landlady then told witness that she could not allow her
							daughter to leave as she had been recommended to her by someone. Accused
							asked Victoria why she would go with [her] mother, and the woman replied
							she did not wish to, whereupon Pisani drew a revolver from his coat
							pocket and fired at Victoria. The landlady rushed out of the room and
							locked herself into the opposite one, while witness ran out calling for
							help and as she was going downstairs heard another shot. Witness did not
							go back to the house but took the next train to Port Said. Emin Wasfi,
							mamour of the Mousky ranebl, was the next witness heard on Friday. His
							evidence differed in no essential detail from that of Captain Quartier,
							and Said Mustaqha was next called and deposed to having arrested
							accused. The first witness examined on Saturday morning was the medical
							adviser to the Austrian Consulate. The woman Victoria deposed witness,
							had two wounds which had evidently been inflicted by one bullet. The
							first wound was on the under surface of the right arm, oblique in
							direction, and superficial, it being caused by the Bullet grazing the
							arm, which the woman held up to protect herself. The second wound was
							serious. It was on the anterior right side of the thorax and had
							penetrated into the thoracic cavity, lacerating a portion of the rights
							lung. He had sent her to hospital and thought she would not be able to
							appear for at least ten days Giorgio Mascarelli, who lived with Vitoria
							Dehan, next gave evidence. The woman, he said, was married and her
							husband lived at Port Said, in which town he had made her acquaintance.
							He came into the pension where he and Victoria were living, just after
							the shots had been fired. A revolver was produced in court, and witness
							said it was similar to the one which he had seen lying on the floor of
							the room when he entered. He was aware that accused had had relation
							with VIctoria Dehan; accused and witness had not quarrelled about her.
							Dr. Ismail Hamadi, attached to the Cairo city police deposed to having
							examined the accused. He said that he found a wound on the left side of
							the neck at the junction of the head and neck and behind. THere was an
							irregular opening with a diameter of about half a centimeter. The hair
							in the neighbour-hood of the wound was signed; the wound might have been
							self-inflicted by the left hand. There was also a burn and wound on the
							right cheek, which might possibly have been caused by a piece of glass.
							There were black marks on both hands, especially the left, and also and
							abrasion on the right hand. Dr. Battista Mazzoli was the last witness
							called and deposed to having examined Victoria Dehan at the Garde
							Medicale. His evidence was similar in every respect to that of Dr.
							Basker the first medical witness called the case was then adjourned
							until the 7th pox. when it is hoped that the wounded woman may be able
							to give evidence.</p>
