(Reuter.)</p>

<p>London, May 25.</p>

<p>House of Commons.—There was a lively passage of arms between Mr. Balfour and Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman with reference to fixing a day for a vote of censure. Mr. Balfour
declined to fix a day owing to Sir Henry not having given the undertaking that the debate should be conducted in an orderly manner and because he is bound to see that there is no repetition of Monday's outrage. Sir Henry refused to give the required pledge, but finally added that he had no objection to other Ministers speaking before Mr. Balfour. The latter then fixed the 30th-inst.

<div type="item"><head>OUR PIGMY VISITORS</head>

<head>INTERESTING LECTURE IN CAIRO.</head>

<p>A meeting of the Cairo Scientific Society was held yesterday afternoon at the Kasr-el-Ainy School of Medicine. Dr. Craig presided. After the minutes of the last meeting had
been read by Dr. Wilson, secretary of the society. Dr. Craig called on Dr. Elliot-Smith
to read a paper on "Pigmies.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elliot Smith, whose name is well-known not only in Egypt, but in any part of the world, by those who have studied anatomy, and especially those interested in the anatomy of the brain, then gave a most interesting lecture on pigmies in general, with special reference to those who have recently visited Cairo, and are now on their way to London. He pointed out that the six pigmies, consisting of four males and two females, who had been under their care in the Kasr-el-Ainy Hospital, and who had aroused such interest in the pigmy race, could not be taken as typical specimens. They are considerably smaller than the average pigmy, and had evidently been selected on account of their small size, and of the six, only two, i.e., one man and one woman, are adult. The ages of these two are in all probability approximately 35 years, and those of the other four are, as nearly as Dr. Elliot-Smith could estimate, eleven, seventeen, eighteen, and twenty years
this last being the age of the second woman of the party.</p>

<p>Dr. Elliot-Smith passed a number of photographs round for examination, which showed the bones of the pigmies taken by Rontgen rays, and his lecture was also illustrated by
excellent lantern-slides, which clearly showed up the various characteristics which Dr. Smith pointed out, as for instance the "pepper-corn" hair, the exceedingly broad alae or sides of the nose, and the peculiarly prominent abdomen.
</p>
<p>Questioned by Dr. Wilson as to what he thought of their intelligence, Dr. Elliot-Smith
said he considered that they were of a distinctly keener intellect than the fellaheen of Egypt, and showed much sharpness in recognising objects from drawings.
</p>
<p>Dr. Keatinge remarked that on the afternoon on which the pigmies left Cairo they expressed their great delight at starting for England, by singing and dancing excitedly, and that both their music and their actions greatly resembled those of the negro inhabitants of Egypt.
</p>
<p>We are enable to give a full account of Dr. Elliot-Smith’s most excellent lecture to-day, but hope to be able to reproduce the full text of his paper in an early issue.

<div type="item"><head>CAIRO’S WATER SUPPLY.</head>
<p>In the paragraph we published yesterday under the above heading, a typographical
error occurred. We should have stated that the increase in the water pumped by the Water Company during the past 15 days was 20,000 metres cube per day and not 2,000 m.
The following figures will be of interest. Since the 11th May, when the heat wave commenced, up to the 25th, the company have pumped practically one million metres cube. In 14 days this gives an average of 70,000 m. per day. For the corresponding 14 days last year they pumped 700,000 m, making a difference of 300,000 m. in 14 days, or rather over 20,000 m. increase per day. This will be of interest to the public,
as showing the great effect the temperature has on the water consumption. 70,000 m.
per day among, say, 60,000 people gives 116 litres per head per day, which we are sure cannot be considered a bad supply. The official of the Water Company whom we interviewed on the subject said : "If the public would only try to assist the company during these hot times by preventing waste as much as possible, they would. Besides making things easier for the company, greatly benefit themselves."

<div type="item"><head>THE COTTON TRADE.</head>

<p>The committee of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, in their
quarterly report, say— "During the past three months the cotton industry has continued in a state of prosperity which is without precedent for more than 20 years. From the beginning of January to the end of April the margin between the price of middling American cotton and 32’s twist yarn shows an average of 3‘47d. per lb., which is more than 1/2d. per lb. higher than the average for the corresponding period last year. Under these favorable circumstances handsome profits are now being realised by American spinners, and the accumulated adverse balances of the recent bad seasons are being rapidly swept away. Our members have been fully employed during the whole of the year and are gradually recovering from the effects of the prolonged short time working of the past year. Unfortunately, there is as yet no marked improvement in the Egyptian section of the trade.”

<head>DEPARTS FOR CONSTANTINOPLE.</head>

<p>The Khedive left Alexandria for Constantinople, as arranged, yesterday afternoon. After having received Mustapha Pasha Pehmy, the Premier, and the other Ministers, his Highness embarked on the specially chartered Austrian Lloyd steamer “Amphitrite” at 2.30 p.m. The Khedive was accompanied by H.H. the Khedivah, Prince Abdul Moneim, and the Princesses.
</p>

<p>The vessels in harbour dressed ship on the occasion in honor of his Highness.</p>

<p>"Al Zahir” states that the Khedive will make a present of a diadem ornamented with

<div type="item"><head>EMPIRE DAY CONCERT.</head>

<p>An open-air concert was held at the Kasr el Nil Barracks on Wednesday evening in
celebration of the anniversary of Empire Day. An excellent programme had been arranged by Mr. R Watson Ramsey, bandmaster of the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, and a large audience was present to enjoy it. The concert was commenced at 9.30 p.m. by the playing of Gounod’s overture “Mirella" by the Inniskilling Fusiliers' band, and this was followed by a comic song, "Shifted lower down," sung by Private McCracken, who was loudly encore. Next came Mr. Lloyd-Jones, who gave us an excellent rendering of Martial’s well-known song, “The River of Years,” and he Was followed by Major J. P. Donegan, R.A.M.C, who scored the great success of the evening. Major Donegan started with a splendid parody on "The Boys of the Old Brigade” entitled "The Time Expired," and this was succeeded by another parody on "Peace," the song sung by the Rajah of Bhong in the "Country Girl.” Major Donegan received encore after encore but was always prepared with an encore verse, none of which failed to draw great applauds on account of their originality and their references to the profession of the greater part of his audience. The first half of the programme was concluded by a
display of club-swinging by Private J. McCreanor in which he showed great cleverness and smartness in the handling of the clubs.
</p>
<p>In the second-half Lieutenant G. C. Adams sang “The Muleteers" and greatly pleased the audience with his rendering of it, and when as an encore be gave us "A Laughing Song” we were all compelled to laugh with him. Captain Tucker was in excellent voice , and the good old Irish song "The Old Plaid Shawl" well suited him, and made us wish for more, but want of time forbade any more encores being given. We must not omit to mention Mrs. Jackson and Private A. Hendry, who added to the comic element of the concert, and Sergeant Downes, R.E., who sang "Why did they sell Killarney." An excellent entertainment was there brought to a close at 11.30 p.m. by the playing of "God Save the King."

<head>FAMILIES ASSOCIATION</head>

<p>On Thursday 18th inst. the annual meeting of the Alexandria branch of the Soldiers and Sailors’ Families’ Association was held at the General’s House, Mohamem Bey, Mrs….the acting president was in the chair, and of the committee Mrs. Gamble (vice-president) Mrs. Gordon and the Rev. H. B Norman-Lee were present. The attendance, for various reasons, was, unfortunately, not as large as last year. Among those present were Mm. Degiarde, Mme. Stouts, Miss Demeah, Mme. William Pegna, Mme. Mario Vells, Miss Pegna, Mrs. John Ross, Mrs. Lawrence, Mr. and Mrs. Moss, Mrs. Field and Col. Watson.
</p>
<p>After reading the balance sheets of both the general and clothing ends, the general and clothing funds, the host secretary (Major Ludlow) thanked the members of the committee for the assistance that had given the past, and especially asked for a vote of thanks to Mrs. Gamble who, whilst already having by far the largest number of women to look after, had also most kindly undertaken the care of those of the Anny Ordnance Department, owing to there being no lady of that department in the garrison. He also expressed the great regret of the committees at the serious illness of Mrs. Norman Lee, and spoke of the loss her absence was to them. He then offered the hearty thanks of the committee to those ladies who so very kindly undertaken the work of collecting clothing and money for the association and paid a special tribute to the very great generosity and kindness of the foreign ladies, who not only by their generous gifts of money and clothing but by their kindly interest in the wives and children of soldiers of the Army of Occupation had very largely associated the committee. He explained that the wives and children of noncommissioned officers and men were not able to leave Egypt every year, when the hot weather commenced, like ordinary individuals, and that very often they had to remain out in this country for four or five years without change , and naturally become liable to the various ill effects which always result from a prolonged residence in a hot climate. He referred to the work of the clothing branch, which apart from ordinary cases enable the committee to provide with warm clothing, women and children, who after several years in the country, were ordered home to the much colder climate of England. In conclusion he again thanked the foreign ladies on behalf of the General Officer Commanding the officers, N.C officers and men of the Army of Occupation for their most generous and kindly co-operation in the work of the association. Special votes of thanks were passes to Mme. Degiarde, Mme. Alekakis, and Miss Demech.
