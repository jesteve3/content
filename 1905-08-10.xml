“TRAFFIO" AND THE STATE RAILWAYS.
We feel that we owe no apology to our readers for devoting farther space to the subject of our railways and to the reforms therein which ore being, and will be, undertaken in the near future. Whilst we feel indebted to oar esteemed contributor *Traffic” for the articles with which ha has favored as, ha mast allow as to state that in oar opinion they fail to affect the conclusions we arrived at, and which we published on the first appearance of the Report of Lord Farrer's Commission. For convenience of publication, '-Traffic's" recent reply to oar remarks was divided into two parts, and for reason! which we will explain, our present remark) will to a great extent follow that division. If we take the first part of “Traffic's" contribution by itself; it shows signs of common ground on which this interesting subject can be usefully discussed. In our earliest remarks upon the Report of Lord Farrar's Commission we used the word "hurriedly” in reference to the work performed, and we "ha to never been amongst those who considered that we had enough of the Commission's time. The circumstances of the case may certainly . have required that something more clearly defined and comprehensive was necessary, bat the authorities could hardly have expected this when selecting gentlemen os members of the Commission from among there who were so concerned in other important duties, that their absence from England could not be of long duration. We regarded the matter ourselves much in the light of a reference to a consulting physician who gives his opinion and leaves the are to others. In the likening of a railway to any other commercial undertaking we are greatly in accord with "Traffic." We agree

</div>


that there is nothing in it which any man of sufficient practical knowledge and experience cannot master, and, if necessary, reform when accepted lines have been agreed upon. When, however, we come to "Traffic’s” arrangements of deportments, and the position he would accord to the traffic manager, we are compelled to part company. If we re tarn to his principles of trade and commerce, we do not find that, in practice, the head of the sales department has absolute control over baying and building operations. The opinion of the soles manager tho old be valuable, and taken accordingly, bat the bayer and architect look to someone higher thin him m their master. It is true that the success of a railway may depend more upon the traffic manager than upon any other official, and in matters of complication or competition the railway's earnings, and the welfare of the country, may greatly depend upon his wisdom and experience. In the matter of expenditure of every kind, is representations of the requirements of his departments must carry snob weight (involving os they do the security of life and property), that they cannot be lightly set aside. Upon him depends to a great extent whether money is wisely spent, withheld, or wasted, although it is invariably held that he is not concerned in its expenditure, except in so far os it may apply 'to his own establishment, for his training os a rale would not fit him to deal with it, any more than the training of the responsible heads of other departments would fit them to carry oat their work as contractors under his guidance.
This brings as to the second part of “Traffic’s’* reply. We feel that it suddenly descends to a kind of criticism of little value To the supervision of the general manager over the whole of the executive staff might be added "and of all its works,” without conveying the strained meaning attached to it. There is necesarilly a chain of responsibility, not only on a railway, bat in every department of it, and the Commission’s competition treated as absurd in the case of the general manager would, as interpreted by "Traffic,” be also absurd in the case of any important department of any large railway. Whether Kantara is interlocked or not, whether appearances, as hurriedly seen,were for oraganic it,or whether a mistake has been mode in the name or in anything else ; whether signallers may or may not have their books to passing trains ; or whether existing and local circumstances justify certain of the Commission's remarks, are matters too technical for is to touch upon. We took the Report as adopted generally by the authorities, including the head of the railway, and hod every right to export that Mr. Bury’s wide experience and high position at home made him a reliable adviser to the Commission in his part of the work. If we bold to this opinion and are under a mistake, wo are at any rate in the good company, not only of the proprietors of the Great Northern Railway but of numbers who seek and accept Mr. Bary’s services.


LORD KITCHENER’S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE.
Since he has been in Simla this year Lord Kitchener has been much occupied in superintending the improvements which were commenced last year in the lower bungalow which forms the main portion of Snowdon, hie Excellency's official residence. Snowdon was originally bought from General Pater Innes by Lord Roberta in 1873-1, and was purchased from the latter, say* "Men and Women o India,” by the Government for about Rs.80,000. Since Lord Kitchener has been in residence there he has made so many alterations that the house can honestly be said to hare been completely transformed. Not only has he built a delightful dining-room, possessing oar red wall and ceilings, bat he has constructed a main hall and staircase, which are ornamented with trophies of the chase and spoils of war, Among those latter may be mentioned the curious coat-of-arms in carved oak which originally formed the back of tin canopy under which President Kroger used to sit is the Raad Seal at Pretoria, and beneath which the famous ultimatum, which led to the rub of his country and himself; was signed. Then there are banners and Hags taken at Omdnrman as well as in South Africa, and curious old arms without number. The old ball-room has been considerably enlarged and improved, the electric light U being installed throughout the entire block of buildings, and the construction of a library promise to convert "Snowdon" into a residence which will ha worthy of the famous soldier who has taken an interest in its improvement.
