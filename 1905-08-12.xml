            THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE.
            We cannot say that the latest news from the United States gives any sore hope oi peace. M. de Witte has reiterated, time oat of mind, that Russia will pay no war indemnity, and even though the tribute levied oo the vanquiahed be styled "a reimbursement for war expenses”—an expression we oan cordially recommend to future conqueror*—we doubt whether all the gilding in the world will make Russia swallow the pilL The long delay sinoe the victory of Mokdan has onoe more given the Russians time to reorganise their foroes and fill op their gaps, and though Qeneral Iinievitch does not bear the reputation of a great strategist, and refugees from the scene of action tell stories of demoralisation and incipient matiny among his soldiers, still, it must be remembered that similar tales have been spread abroad sinoe Liao Yang, and that, in spite of them all, the Russian armies have never been routed, in the tense ol being not only defeated, bat demoralised for a considerable period after their defeat ; that, with the ooe exoeption of Port Arthur, avoidable surrenders on a large soale have been unknown; and that the Russian soldier, in spite of his iacompetent officers and imperfect training, always fights stubbornly, and retreats with regret The viotory of Tsushima has saved Japan from all risk at defeat and has assured Liautong, Korea Md Bsfbalien to her soldiers, bat the Russian armies may fight a retreating battle, draw away to Lake Baikal or the Upper Amor valley, and, maintaining half a million man there, weary the Japeoese, who will be obliged to tutataio an approximately qual force in
            Manchuria, into a oompromiao. In the ahock of battle the Japanese are perhaps invincible, but will even the heroes of the Shaho, Mukden, and Port Arthur prove themselves human after another two years of indecisive war t In the itixUsnth c-tntury one of the ablest of Asiatics, Toyotomi Hideyoahi, the Taiko-sama, or Great Lord, as the worshipper* at the shrine of his soul call him, led Japan to a five years' war of oinqueet in Korea against the Chinese and Koreans, whioh ended in the failure of all his plans, not so much through iU-euooess, as through the bitter home-sickness which is one of the prioea a patriotic army has to pay for a long campaign across the seas. Our soldier* undoubtedly grew homaiiok and ‘stale’ in South Africa, and it will be atrange if even the mo*t ardent Japaneee soldier ha* not aome of the edge taken ofi hi* martial temper *fter more rainy aummen and icy winter.- in the Manchurian plains.
            AU will depend, in our opinion, on the ability of Russia to play a long, slow, and unattractive game, without hope of any real victory—for the prisee of the.war must be to the Japaneee—but simply and solely with a view to making the peaoe terms leu onerous. And we submit that on this point the Russians themselves are the only possible judges. Were the revolutionary party in Russia led by oapable men, a long war might lead to the tall of the Tsardom, bat the earning cruise of the Potemkin, the failure of the striker* at Odessa to do more than provoke a nmnere, and the fact that a large section of the Russian people •teem* oontented with the promite* of relorm solemnly affirmed by the Tsar, makes u< inclined to suspect that the Tsar’e government will take the risk* of revolution. Bat a long struggle in the Bast must still further weaken Russian infiuenoe and prestige in the West, and from this obvious decline of her infiuenoe and prestige, mast be born the inducements to make peaoe quickly with the Japaneee. The mast pro-Gercn«a Russian cannot but feel dismayed at tho growth of German influence in theNearEi*t,theadvooato of expansion in the Middle Bast must feel alarm at tho rapid extension of British infiuenoe in the Persian Gulf; and it must be a galling reflection that Russia oau have now no say in Scandinavian politics, and oannot offer France more than platonio support in Moroooo. Thirty years ago Russia might perhaps have abandoned western politios and striven for years to minimise defeat in theEtst,but events move rapidly now-a-days, and Russia’s effaoe meat as a European power for a few years may prove a terrible handicap to her for another generation.
