                    with the view of the judicial adviser
                    that the engagement of england as regards 
                    the suez canal convention of 1888 requires to be
                    regarded as seperate and distinct from that
                    of egypt.  But, he adds, if that view be correct, 
                    how does the case stand great bririan was a party
                    to the convention with a certain reservaation which,
                    she maintained, absolved her from complaince with its
                    stupulations in 1898.  By the anglo-french agreement
                    of april 8 1904, she declared her adherence to
                    the stipulations of the suez canal treat, but
                    that- i am quoting from the anglo french
                    agreement itself- the last sentence of paragraph
                    1 and that of paragraph 2 of article
                    VIII. of this treaty will remain suspended.
                    Is not this another reservation which, unimportant 
                    though it be, may enable her, at any 
                    time, to take up the position which she assumed
                    in 1898, or, by parity of reasoning, enable
                    other powers to maintain that the suez canal
                    convention is inoperative. I confess that i do
                    not consider the situation as entirely satisfactory.

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE</head>
                    <head>FEDORA</head>
                    <p>The performance of fedora at the khedivial
                    opera house last night, thanks to signa
                    pandolfini, was a great success.  Signa 
                    pandolfini is a thorough artiste adn an actress
                    of a very high order.  Her rendering of fedora
                    was, if possible, better than her tosca.  Signor
                    Giraud was variable, though undoubtedly good
                    in the last act; his singing in the second act
                    was not at all that we should have wished:
                    he sang more than once sharp (one natural
                    was turned into sharp) and did not always
                    seem to have hold of his note.  Inaccuracies
                    were numerous and hardly justified, and he 
                    seems to have a difficulty in taking really
                    high notes.  We may mention a most admirable
                    high C by signa pandolfini.  Signor rubini
                    delivered his solo very effectively in act
                    1. Signor Polese was good and sang well, but
                    he has not the sme chance as in la tosca; he 
                    is a real chef de police, and as such probably
                    finds diplomacy too tame an occupation.  The 
                    chorus is unusually good, and the khedivial
                    theatre heave-in that branch-spent their
                    money to real advantage.  Indeed, in theatrical
                    accessories cairo need not fear competition, 
                    so long as the present conditions are in force.
                    Rigoletto is to be given tonight.  We hope
                    that some improvement will be effected therein.
                    In this connection it is interesting to note that 
                    in alexandria-as in cairo-signor tomisani
                    seems to have scored a brilliant success in that
                    opera.  Though our fellow critics may take
                    exception to his methods, a glance at the scores
                    of the operas in which he sings will show that
                    he handles his high notes with an ease and
                    dexterity apparently foreign to his better
                    known rivals of the state theatre. Whatever
                    his compatriots may think of his tone, it
                    undoubtedly pleases the anglo-saxon in general;
                    and we could wish that-but we are
                    criticising the khedivial theatre, and it is as
                    well to remind our readers that siberia, also
                    by giordano (whose compositions seem to be
                    above the average) will be given on saturday.
                    Let us mention, before we close, that signora
                    tromben really showed to advantage in her part.  
                    As long as great and startling efforts are
                    not required of her, she is quite pleasing.</p></div>

                    <p>The performance of I Puritani yesterday
                    evening served once more to show the incomparable
                    talent of signora isabella svicher.
                    this gifted ladys vocal organs are very extended;
                    she possesses more than three octaves, 
                    which is phenomenal.  She recieved a perfect
                    ovation at the end of the 2nd act, and was
                    repeatedly called before the curtain.  Sig
                    tomisani, in the difficult role of lord arthur,
                    also obtained a great success, and sig. baldelli,
                    as sir george, distinguished himself.
                    We were more than surprised to find a sparsely
                    filled house last night.  It is astonishing that, 
                    when such a rare opportunity of hearing one of
                    the bright particular lights of the operatic world
                    is afforded alexandrians, they do not flock to the
                    theatre.  A more fickle public than is that of
                    alexandria it would be impossible to find.  Has a 
                    soiree noire, with all its debasing suggestiveness,
                    been announced, it would be safe to say that the 
                    playhouse, which is now adorned by such brilliant
                    artistes, would have been filled to overflowing.
                    Tomorrow evening, carmen will be given, with signa 
                    bellincioni in the leading role, and we hope to see
                    a bumper house.</p></div>

                    <head>EUROPEAN ATTACKED NEAR SUEZ</head>
                    <p>From our correspondent
                    Suez, February 9
                    A european named gilbert, who had failed
                    to find employment at suez, decided to go to
                    suakin, and not having money to pay his passage,
                    set out on the 25th ganuary last en route
                    for suakin on foot.  His belongings he carried
                    on his back in a bag which contained papers
                    of identity, certificates, a knife, paper, pen and
                    pencils, the sum of P.T. 9.5, a pair of boots,
                    and some clothes.  For provisions he had only a
                    bag of sea biscuits and he carried two empty
                    water bottles.  On the morning of the 27th
                    January, after having passed the attaka
                    mountains, he encountered near the shore
                    about half a dozen native fishermen, who
                    recieved him cordially and gave him fish and
                    bread to eat.  After a good rest, gilbert
                    proceeded in the direction of the mountains,
                    where he took shelter for the night.
                    Early on the following day, he descended
                    the mountains and went on his way, meeting with
                    no untoward incident, but next day, at about 
                    noon, he encountered two bedouins, whom he
                    asked for water.  The latter gave him to understand
                    that if he followed them they would 
                    take him to some wells, which the traveller
                    did without the slightest suspicion.  On the 
                    way he made them aware of the fact that he 
                    was a poor man, and that on account of this
                    he was obliged to walk to suakin in order
                    to find employment.
                    After several hours walk, seeing no trace of
                    water, and being exhausted, he proposed that
                    they should all have a rest, and accordingly sat
                    down on a rock.  Suddenly the younger of the 
                    bedouins, who was at a distance of about 50 
                    yards from gilbert, began to swear at him, and
                    raising his gun, fired.  Gilvert was slightly wounded
                    in the back, but his bag prevented a serious
                    wound.  The bedouin afterwards reloaded his
                    gun and asked gilbert to place all his belongings
                    at a certain spot.  This was done without 
                    hesitation.  While the bedouin was occupied 
                    with his gun, gilbert managed to creep from
                    rock to rock, and, favored by the darkness, 
                    succeeded in eluding the bedouins.  After a long 
                    march the whole of the night he arrived at
                    daybreak at a small coast guard station, where
                    he was well recieved.  Here he remained till the
                    1st inst., when he was offered a camel, and, in 
                    company of a coast guard named mahmoud, 
                    he reached the attaks mountains, where there
                    is a coast guard station.  The governor of Suez
                    was at once advised of the matter, and,
                    accompanied by the chief of the police, a doctor, 
                    and several gendarmes, proceeded to the spot
                    to hold an enquiry.  Finally, gilvert was
                    conveyed to the french hospital at suez, where
                    he still remains, on account of his wounds.</p></div>

                    and 15, was forging ahead steadily and at one
                    time held the lead by 62 points and appeared
                    to have the game well in hand, but the back
                    mark man, nothing daunted, played a most
                    plucky game, and ultimately won, amidst
                    great applause, by the narrow margin of
                    one point.</p></div>
