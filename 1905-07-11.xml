                        <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                        <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and
                            Outside work</p>
                        <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in
                            all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and
                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic
                            and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in
                            hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours, great
                            weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends itself to
                            every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the
                            advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                            cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact
                            that it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                                Balfour’s statement of the 11th of May was severely criticised. Lord
                                Roberts said that the lessons of the South African war were already^
                                forgotten. He had no hesitation in saying that the army is as
                                absolutely unfitted and unprepared for war now as it was then. The
                                nation must choose between conscription and universal training.

                                <p> The country is suffering considerably this year from the high
                                    price of cereals. Durrah and beans, which form the principal
                                    ingredient in the diet of the fellah, have reached the price of
                                    P,T. 9 to 10 per keila. In spite of the excellent barley crop in
                                    the Mariout district, for which the abundant rains of last
                                    winter are responsible, the price of barley has risen to from
                                    P.T. 63 to 65 per ardeb, against an average of P.T. 45 per ardeb
                                    in 1904, when the rain crop was to all intents and purposes
                                    non-existent The English and Con­tinental breweries have bought
                                    up a very large proportion of this year’s crop, and the barley
                                    from the rain belt is evidently in as high request among brewers
                                    as ever. The present price of these cereals makes the feeding of
                                    horses and cattle a very costly affair. The bersim is over and
                                    the poorer owners of cattle and horses are sometimes obliged to
                                    give their beasts half rations. </p>

                                <p> It is stated that the Land Bank of Egypt has announced that it
                                    will issue no further loans on mortgages till the end of
                                    September. This bank has already placed upwards of £1,300,000 on
                                    similar loans since its founda­tion six months ago. The other
                                    mortgage-banks are only accepting on an average about 5 per
                                    cent, of the transactions proposed. The natural result of this
                                    action on their part is the growth of a certain uneasiness among
                                    land-owners, who find great difficulty in obtaining the money
                                    required for the exploitation of their lands. The Agricultural

                                    to note that 54 belonged to the Khedivial Mail Line, 48 to
                                    Bell’s Asia Minor Company, 40 to the Prince Line, 36 to the

                                    Lawrence Line, and 5 to the P. and O. Company. Of the 92 Italian
                                    steamers, 65 belonged to the Florio-Rubattino Company. 51 of the

                            <head>BRITISH TRADE IN EGYPT. MR. FREEMAN’S REPORT.</head>
                            <p>In his report on the trade of Alexandria for 1904 Mr. Vice-Consul
                                Freeman remarks ;— The answer to the question why the United Kingdom
                                is, or at any rate seems to be, grad­ually losing the largest share
                                in respect of the total imports is perhaps to be found in the
                                wonderfully prosperous condition of the country.i, the greater
                                attention that it consequently, attracts among Continental
                                manufacturers and merchants, and in the keener desire aroused on 9
                                their part to enter so tempting a market. The contributions of
                                countries other than those specified in the table have more than
                                doubled in the space of four years. Postal parcels and the various
                                goods included under the heading of “Other imports” have likewise
                                doubled in four years. The expansion is spread over all categories
                                and almost all items, and the stock inquiry : “Where are there
                                openings for British trade ?” can best be answered with the one word
                                “everywhere.” But at the same time I can only repeat the 8took
                                advice to manufacturers, jointly or singly, to have agents on the
                                spot and to send more travellers. As the representative of a group
                                of British firms remarked to me, the native tastes may not change,
                                the same class of goods may be in demand for years, but nevertheless
                                local requirements should be studied at the outset, and regular,
                                periodical visits are necessary to ensure a hold on the market. The
                                agents at Alexandria of a British firm dealing in carpenters’ and
                                blacksmiths’ tools and also in Sheffield goods in general wrote to
                                this Con­sulate as follows:—“The difficulty with our principals
                                arises from the fact that the native does not use the same tools as
                                the British workman. Many modifications and additions have
                                consequently to be made so as to adapt the tools to what is required
                                on our markets. If it were a question of a few articles only, the
                                difficulty could easily be overcome by sending home samples ; but as
                                there are a thousand and probably more lines that have to be
                                attended to you will easily understand how impossible it is for an
                                agent who is neither a carpenter nor a blacksmith to give them all
                                the particulars they want. We there­fore suggested that they should
                                send out either one of the partners in their firm or a competent
                                traveller, who, with our help, might secure the first orders. What
                                we have to complain of most in the firms at home is that, although
                                oar markets are invaded by an army 'of foreign travellers, they (the
                                British firms) do not take the trouble or care to incur the expense
                                of sending out competent men to see What others are doing. We may
                                give you as an instance the case of Messrs whose turnover with us
                                was very small until they decided to send out one of the partners of
                                the firm. They are now doing many more thousands than they did
                                hundreds.” </p>
                            <p>Another British commercial traveller told me that his quotation for
                                certain goods was 18s. per cwt. (If. 16s. per 100 kilos.) with three
                                months’ credit, while the German quotation, thanks partly to the
                                drawback in Germany, was 25 fr. (1/.) per 100 kilos., with six
                                months’ credit. The British article was of course better, and some
                                people preferred it, but it was not, as the priced would seem to
                                show, worth nearly twice as much as the German article. With such
                                competition as this to face, merchandise, however excellent in
                                itself, can scarcely be left to speak for itself with any prospect
                                of success. I hear of machinery being bought in the United Kingdom
                                by German firms and sold at Alex­andria more cheaply than if it were
                                imported direct. Here again there is surely scope for the energies

                                increasing numbers, and it is becoming almost impossible to answer

                                Friday next are almost completed. A large and well-decorated
                                triumphal arch has been erected at the Boulac entrance of the
                                Esbekieh Gardens, and this will be illuminated on the night of the
                                14th. A wooden pavilion has been erected in the gardens for the
                                official receptions and a stage has also b3en erected for a variety
                                entertainment which will be given by the troupe of the “Nouveautés.”
                                The gardens are gaily decorated with flags and promise to look most
                                effective when lit up by the numerous Chinese lanterns and electric
                                globes which are hung in every direction. The bands of the 2nd Royal
                                lnniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry will perform
                                alternately throughout the even­ing, and there will also be a grand

                            <p>All entrances to the gardens except the Boulac one will be closed and
                                this will be opened at 9 p.m. The officers of the Egyptian Army and
                                the Army of Ocupation have accepted the invitation of the committee
                                to assist at the festivities. </p>

                        <p>The weather is becoming more oppressive than ever, owing to the hot
                            khamseen winds. Fever is daily on the increase, both among the natives
                            and Europeans, especially among the railway people. The latest victim in
                            hospital is Mr. W. H. Bailey, Inspector of Bridges, Suakin-Atbara Line,
                            who is, however, pro­gressing favorably towards recovery. </p>
                        <p> The following passengers are leaving by the S.S. Dakahlieh to-day, viz.,
                            Mr. Smart, chief storekeeper, Suakin Railway, who is being invalided
                            home to England, Mr. Fulton and Mr. Finlay, also of the Suakin-Atbara
                            Rail­ways, who are likewise returning to England invalided as unfit for
                            Suakin. </p>
                        <p> Mr. Ward, chief engineer of the Sudan Government steamer Hawk, having
                            resigned his appointment with the Sudan Government, also leaves to-day
                            by the Dakahlieh. </p>
                        <p> Dr. Crispin, senior medical officer, Suakin Moudirieh, is also a
                            passenger by the S.S. Dakahlieh. He is going on three months’ leave of
                            absence, which he will spend in England. Daring the absence of Dr.
                            Crispin, Dr. Ibra­him Effendy Fahmy will act as S.M.O. </p>

                        <head>EGYPTIAN LAND AND GENERAL TRUST.</head>
                        <p>The report of the Egyptian Land and General Trust, Ltd., submitted to the
                            statutory meeting on the 6th instant, states that with a view to
                            spreading the company’s investments over as wide a field as possible,
                            the directors are acquiring a large building area in the heart of Cairo,
                            and their agent-general in Egypt, Mr. Hooker, who has recently been to
                            London to confer with the board, has just left for Egypt to complete the
                            arrangements, subject to the titles of the property proving
                            satisfactory. If this business is concluded the directors have no
                            hesitation in saying that it will be a most satis­factory investment for
                            the company. The direc­tors are also on the point of completing the
                            purchase of some very valuable budding land in Alexandria which has been
                            strongly recommended to them by their local advisers. The directors feel
                            that when these transactions are concluded the shareholders will have a
                            considerable interest in the heart of the two most important cities in
                            Egypt—namely, Cairo and Alexandria, which cannot fail to give most
                            satisfactory results. In view of the growing importance of the Egyptian
                            Mining industry, the directors are supporting on favorable terms the
                            issue of the Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd. In this they are
                            acting in conjunction with the United African Explo­rations, Ltd. The
                            Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd., is formed to acquire what
                            appears to be one of the most important mineral concessions in Egypt The
                            concession comprises an area of some 3,000 square miles, and it is
                            reported upon by responsible engineers as being rich in gold, silver,
                            lead, copper and emerald mines. The directors have also before them
                            various proposals, which are-likely to materialise shortly, for the
                            development of sound and profitable business in other direc­tions. The
                            Board have elected Mr. Charles H. Rigg as a director to represent his
                            substantial financial interest in the company. </p>
                        <p>July 5 was fixed by the committee of the London Stock Exchange as a

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—I should be greatly obliged if you would, through your columns, call
                            the atten­tion of the Cairo police to another street nuisance which
                            exists. At most of the junctions of two streets cabstands exist, and the
                            cabmen appear to think that they have a right to stand in such a manner
                            that the passage of pede­strians is entirely obstructed. The cabmen
                            naturally wish to look for fares along both roads, and draw up their
                            cabs accordingly, the general public have to go round them in the middle
                            of the road, which has pos­sibly been recently watered. The stand
                            opposite the Cafe Chicha is perhaps one of the worst cases in point
                            There is always a policeman on duty at this place, but he does nothing
                            to ameliorate the nuisance, and when complained to it is with the
                            greatest difficulty that one can drive into his head that the cabman is
                            in any way out of order. Personally, I invariably insist on the cab
                            being removed. Sometimes I am met with abuse or stolid resistance, but,
                            being fluent in the language, I finally get my way. Frequently the
                            cabman returns to his former position immediately I have passed, and
                            remains there. It surely would be an easy matter to explain to the
                            policemen, either individually or collectively when on parade, the
                            rights of pedestrians, or simpler still, to pat a red paint mark on the
                            footpath indicating the limits of the cabstand. Apologising for
                            troubling you,—I am, etc., </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—At the hotels in Egypt collecting cards for the S. P. C. A. are
                            in evidence for support, bat at Port Said at least they are not likely
                            to get much as long as the dis­gusting scenes occur while cattle are
                            being landed. The poor beasts are slung by the feet or horns, kept for
                            hours without water, most likely from the port at which they embark, and
                            on landing try to drink from the sea. </p>
                        <p>On Tuesday the passengers on a ship in quarantine (therefore unable to
                            take steps) were entertained by the following exhibition of cruelty. A
                            cow ran away from the herd and was chased out on the breakwater by three
                            or four savages, her tail was twisted, she was stoned on the head and
                            body with rocks of about 20 lbs., beaten unmercifully with battens 3
                            inches thick, sticks were thrust into her anus and vagina, she was
                            thrown off the breakwater into the sea, a fall of 12 feet, dragged over
                            the rocks that cut her hide, hauled up again in a most brutal fashion,
                            her horns torn off and blood was streaming from her nostrils. This
                            performance took about two hours. We are used to seeing acts of cruelty,
                            but not such refined brutality as this. If the S. P. C. A. has a
                            representative, he should be on the spot where these things happen or
                            else he is not much use.—I am, etc., </p>

                    <p>Encore sous l’influence de la liquidation de fin du mois, notre marché a
                        débuté calme et insignifiant On s’attendait même à ce que cet état de
                        marasme durut toute la semaine, lorsque l’heureuse issue des négociations
                        franco-allemandes et la nomination définitive de ministres plénipotentiaires
                        russo-japonais en vue de la paix ont remis à flot les bourses européennes ;
                        ce qui a été d’autant plus facile que le capital abonde en Europe. </p>
                    <p>A tons ces motifs de hausse est encore venu s’ajouter un facteur important:
                        la reprise soudaine et considérable des cotons à la suite du rapport du
                        Bureau d’Agriculture de Washington sur les prévisions de la prochaine
                        récolte. Sur notre place, pourtant, la spéculation continue à négliger les
                        sociétés nouvelles pour concentrer toute son attention sur les anciennes,
                        dites à tranche dorée. On a pu remarquer cette tendance chez un grand nombre
                        de maisons financières de notre ville qui estiment sans doute que ces
                        valeurs ont été trop dépréciées à l’occasion des derniers lancements de
                        compagnies.</p>
                    <p>La valeur qui a donné lieu au plus fort mouvement est l’Agricole en raison de
                        l’ouverture de la souscription des nouveaux titres à partir du 10 juillet
                        jusqu’au 2 octobre. Ce fait a de suite attiré des acheteurs. Certains
                        spéculateurs même, pensant que les nouveaux titres ne seraient livrés qu’au
                        2 octobre, c’est-à dire avec un trimestre de crédit, eurent bientôt fait de
                        les pousser jusqu’à 9 13/16, tandis que l’ancienne émission ne dépassait pas
                        13 7/8 ; mais, à peine surent-ils que des certificats provisoires au porteur
