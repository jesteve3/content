            <p>There are one or two indications that the strike is weakening on account of lack of
              funds, and the general conditions of scarcity which affect all classes. A manifesto
              was issued by the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40787">Tsar</persName>
              to-night appointing M. Witte Prime Minister, with powers to co-ordinate and unify the
              different branches of the administration. It also grants civic liberties to the people
              and extends the legislative powers of the National Assembly, besides enlarging the
              franchise. It is rumoured that the crews of four ships of the Black Sea Squadron have
              mutinied, and that Admirals Bir[ ] and Tchuknin have been murdered. It is also
              rumoured that General Trepoff has been assassinated. (Reuter)</p>

            <p>The Tsar has promulgated a manifesto in which he says that in presence of agitations
              threatening the integrity and the unity of the empire, he has resolved to unify the
              action of the superior Government, and he has granted the Duma to the empire on the

              meeting, and association, and with participation of all classes in the elections to
              the Duma and surveillance over all the acts of the authorities. (Havas) </p>

                After a cross-examination the murderer was identified as <persName>Omar

                and that they had quarrelled with each other not long before the murder. The strange

              develops. The steamers on their return voyage will proceed direct from Alexandria to
              Marseilles. The Compagnie de Navigation Mixte possesses fourteen steamers and has a

            <p>I have to-day had a most interesting talk with one of the gentlemen who were on board
              the ill-fated Behara when she struck a rock close to <placeName>Aquada</placeName> on
              the <placeName>Burmese coast</placeName> some few weeks ago. The vessel is one of the
              very fast Indian and Burmese mailboats, and owing to rainy, misty weather and abnormal
              currents, drove on to the reefs, with which, it would appear, this coast is strewn.
              The vessel struck at 10 a.m. and the crew, without the loss of a single life or even
              the injury of a man, had by nightfall taken ashore, at great risk, the entire 1,352
              passengers, and had by daylight next day removed everything of value to safety on the
              island, which was four miles away. The remains of this 'fine ship are, I am told,

              the council, but that at its last sitting the Moudirieh of Tantah enrolled only eighty
              Syrians as electors, of whom twenty are long since dead. The petitioners begged the
              Ministry to order the election to be delayed. But it is reported from Tantah that the
              elections have taken place and that the appointments have already been made. In our

            <head>THE ZEIDIEH TWELVE VIRTUES.</head>
            <p>Our Ottoman contemporary “Turk” states that, in 1891, when the Yemen province was in
              revolt, <persName>Imam El-Mansour Billah</persName> died leaving, at Host village, which he occupied,
              fifteen thousand men-at-arms. Imam El-Mansour Billah was the father of the <persName>Imam Yahia</persName>,
              and in his will he desired that his son should succeed him in the Imamet. According to
              the Zuidi sect, the Imam (Caliph) must possess the following twelve peculiar
              qualifications :— He must be a descendant of Ali and Fatimah (daughter of the Prophet)
              ; must be learned ; diligent; religious; handsome and physically sound ; generous;
              zealous; brave; honest and must go to war in person and not prefer peace to war when
              the latter is necessary, taking the law as his guide ; he must also be economical in
              his home life, and his people must have full confidence in him and must agree to
              acknowledge him as their Caliph. The followers of Imam El Mansonr were doubtful
              whether his son Yahia possessed all these qualifications. However, complying with his
              father’s will, they acknowledged him as their Imam. The Zeidieh confess no Caliph
              except their own because they say, no other Imam can possess the twelve qualifications
              of the Imamet.</p>

            <head>“DOING” EGYPT ON SKATES.</head>
            <head>ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR</head>
            <p>A visitor arrived at Alexandria yesterday from Europe, who intends “doing” Egypt and
              the Sudan in a highly original manner, his means of locomotion bring nothing more nor
              less than a pair of road skates-—or, when the roads are rough, his own sturdy legs.
              This enterprising traveler is <persName>Mr. A. W- Crawford</persName>, native of <placeName>St. John</placeName>, <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName> .
              He started a few months ago from <placeName>Rouen</placeName> and has crossed <placeName>France</placeName>, Spain, Algeria and
              <placeName>Tonis</placeName> . Tripoli is a closed country and everyone who desires to traverse it with
              security has to obtain a special permit from the Sublime Porte. Such a permit is
              almost impossible to procure at the present time and moreover necessitates a journey
              to Constantinople, so Mr. Crawford had to give up the idea of making his way to Egypt
              by land, and came on here by way of Malta. He is equipped with a pair of Ritter road
              skates on the acme pattern and intends travelling by the help of these appliances to
              Cairo and thence up the Nile valley to <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> . From Khartoum he will make his way to
              <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName> and on to <placeName>Adan</placeName> and via <placeName>Persia</placeName>, <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> and <placeName>India</placeName> round the world. At the
              first blush the idea of travelling from Alexandria, to the Sudan and Abyssinia on
              road skates strikes one as being a somewhat eccentric method of locomotion and when
              one thinks, of the vast tracks of desert between here and Abyssinia the adventurous
              spirit that will essay a journey through this part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> in the fashion here
              related is likely to be more pitied, than commended. But Crawford is not actuated by
              the hope of winning a wager or of gaining notoriety. He merely wishes to see if the
              thing can be done without a penny in his pocket, only depending on the assistance and
              encouragement of those who appreciate pluck and endurance. Mr.Crawford, who has
              already covered 5,000 kilometres on foot and on wheel, looks wonderfully fit
              considering the hardships inseparable from an undertaking of such magnitude. Mr.
              Crawford left Rouen on May 1 last and is due at <placeName>Boston</placeName> in April, 1907. He is a good
              specimen of a young Canadian and is the son of the late <persName>Dr. Crawford</persName>, of <placeName>Andover</placeName>, New
              Brunswick.</p>

                Gurney Sheppard</persName>, of <placeName>Leggatta</placeName>, <placeName>North Mimms</placeName>, senior partner in the firm of Sheppards,
                Petty, and Co., 57, Old Broad-street, and the Stock Exchange, a director of the
                London and Lancashire Life Assurance Company, for many years chairman of Dr.
                Bernardo’s Homes, and well known in Egypt owing to his connection with the Aboukir
                Company, who died on October 8, in his seventy-seventh year. Having given largely to
                charitable institutions in his lifetime he leaves nothing to them under his will,
                but he earnestly hopes that his reridnaty legatees will deal liberally with the same
                charities in respect of any written or verbal promise made by him. He gave £50 to
                each clerk and porter who has been in the employment of his firm for 10 years, and
                £25 each for those of five years’ service; and to each domestic servant of five
                years service £10.</p>
