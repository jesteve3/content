                <div type="item"><head>BRITISH versus FOREIGN 1 HADE.</head>
                    <p>We notioe a loading article in a Cairo contemporary in which it is suggested that under the new state of things British manufacturers are likely to benefit to a much greater extent than their foreign competitors from Government orders. We fancy that the writer of the article has assumed that the article in the Anglo-French Agreement which admits the “paramountcy”—there is no better word that wo out think of—of Great Britain in Egypt</p><cb n="5"/>
                        <p>is but the preface of the declaration of some sort of Protectorate in spite of the guarantee contained in the first sentence of the article. Were Egypt a British Protectorate such action on the part of the Government is conceivable— the Philippines and Tunis are examples- but we should have thought that Article IV. of the Agreement, which explicitly safeguards the commercial liberty of Egypt and Mo-rocoo, is a sufficient proof of the purity of the intentions of the parties concerned. -Of conrse, it is possible to read into the last paragraph of this article an attempt to secure exclusive rights, but we imagine that the article was drawn up by honest statesmen, and will bo carried honestly into effect, it is permissible for a highly sospicious mind to
                            argue thus: “	on such conditions as will
                            maintain intact the authority of -the State over these great undertakings”—does rot that a exploitation, with the assent of the British Government, by British capitalists 1 But it is safer to assume, as we do, that the British Government is animated only by the desire to strengthen the bands of the Egyptian Administration in all that concerns concessions.</p></div>
                <div type="item" scope="international"><head>THE BALTIC FLEET</head>
                    <p>A telegram from our Correspondent at Sue; announces that Admiral Batrovosky and bus squadron left Suer for Djibouti this morning. Tne departure of the Russians for the South shows that there is as yet no intention of recalling Admiral Rodjestvensky, whoso object evidently now is to linger at Madagascar or some neutral port until reinforoed by the squadron which left Suez to-day.</p>
                    <p>This change in the Russian fleet's policy has brought about a considerable change in the plan of campaign now being deliberated. Before the actual fall of Port Arthur the Japanese admirals were oontent to await the advent of the Baltic squadron in the waters of the Malayan Archipelago, but now it is lelt that the naval campaign mast be pushed to a decided end without any delay, as yesterday's telegrams as to the arrival of the Japanese at Diego Garcia showed.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese plan of campaign demands that the entire fleet shall be free and available for serious work at the earliest possible moment The attack on Vladivostok, its investment by sea and by land, with the simultaneous occupation of the island of Sakhalin, form the principal points in the immediate future for the Japanese force.</p>
                    <p>Shoald the Baltic fleet,advauce to Eastern waters, the Japanese are prepared to advance considerable distances to welcome it. Fleet auxiliary cruisera will harass the colliers, and, by their superior speed being able-to avoid battle, the Japanese hope to be able to destroy the Russian fleet’s motive power without any serious loss to themselves. The approaches to Vladivostok are singularly well adapted for the interception of an approach ing fleet, and the passage to the Eastern seas abounds in opportunities for those daring torpedo attacks so beloved of the Japanese naval offioer.</p></div>

                    <p>We direct the attention of the public to the communication under the above heading which we print in onr issue of to-day. For the present we will make no oomment at all upon the very serious statements put forward, simply oontenting ourselves with remarking tliat the very fact of such statements being made calls for one of two things, viz., a refutation of the charges by the department impugned, or a searching enquiry into the alleged facts. The Telegraph Department is one of such importance to the general public, that the question of ita efficiency concerns us all. We therefore look for speedy action to be taken in thil matter,</p></div><cb n="6"/> </div>

                        (From Our Own Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Suez, Thursday.</p>
                    <p>The Russian squadron, consisting of four cruisers, “Dnieper," “Rion," “Oleg," and “Izumrud,” and three torpedo-destroyers, “Gromki,” “Gosni," and “Riezvy,” under Admiral Botrovosky, entered the Canal yesterday forenoon. The destroyers reached Ismailia shortly after 4 p.m., when they anchored for the night, and resumed their voyage at 6 30 this morning. The cruisers, having searchlights, came through without stopping, and arrived at Suez at 5 o'clock this morning, anchoring in the Bay. At 10 a.m. the three destroyers came out of the Canal and anchored near the remainder of the squadron.</p>
                    <p>All the ships are fitted with wireless telegraphy apparatus and quick-firing guns. The “Dnieper” and “Rion” (ex “Petersburg" and “Smolensk" respectively), as well as the destroyers, are painted slate colour, while the two other cruisers have the usual Russian naval colour.</p>
                    <p>At this end of the canal they did not take on any coal, but were allowed to take a certain quantity of provisions and live-stock. During their stay they did not communicate with the shore owing to the plague at Suez, and wore flying the voluntary quarantine flags, in order to receive free pratique at Djibouti, where they intend coaling.</p>
                    <p>Several police and Coast Guard launches were patrolling the harbour, and almost similar precautions were taken as before, when the first division passed through.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the arrangements of the Suez Canal Company, no steamer in the canal was detained, in spite of the large traffic.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Squadron intends sailing tonight, or at daybreak to-morrow, for Djibouti.</p>
                    <p>Suez, Friday.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Botrovosky’s squadron sailed at 5.40 this morning for Djibouti.</p></div>

                    <p>In the atternoon his Highness received the Prince d'Arenberg and MM. X. Charmes, Verge, and Mirabeaud, of the Suez Canal Company, M. Bonnet, M. Quellenec, and Harari Pasha.</p>
                        <p>It is stated that his Highness will very probably start on an excursion of three weeks' duration in the Libyan desert about the 25th inst.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>COAST GUARDS ADMINISTRATION.</head><p>
                    Lewa Hunter Pasha, Director-General of tbe Coast Guards Administration, and Mrs. Hunter and friends have gone for a trip down the Red Sea to Suakin and district. They hope to have a very pleasant trip, as the climatic conditions in those parts at this time of the year are excellent.</p>	
                    <p>The ostensible and official reason for this trip is that the Director-General of the administration has gone on a camel purchasing expedition, and Kaimakam Dumreicher Bey is accompanying the expedition in order to give his advice. These constant pleasure trjps of the highest officials of the Coast Guards Administration are always taken on the flimsiest excuse, for it is perfectly obvious that the presence of the Director-General of the administration is not necessary in order to buy camels, which any responsible subordinate officer could undertake. At present it is the busiest season of the year, and there is more opportunity for smuggling when the Customs officials are overworked, owing to the pressure their time due to the great influx of trade at this season, and the absence of Lewa Hunter Pasha on a pleasure excursion has aroused much comment, especially among the native officials in this administration</p></div>

                        <p>These teams met on the parade-ground, Mustapha, on Saturday last, when an interesting game was witnessed by a fair turn-out of spectators. Saint Andrews kicked off against the wind, and some nice exchanges came the way of both sides. The homesters were showing the better combination, and the visitors' defence had their work cut out to keep them from getting through. Success came their way eventually, Walmer taking up the ball from a well placed corner kick, and screwing it in in a most masterly fashion, giving the Saints’ custodian no chance to save. Half-time arrived with the score 1-0. The “Saints” in the second half tried hard to equalise, but, although both ends were visited in turn, no further scoring took place, “C" Company thus retiring victors by 1-0. The following were the teams :—</p>
                        <p>"C" Company:—Muilard, Beile, Dovey, Young, Dovey, Ryan, Clark, Neble, Walmer, Prior and Finnes.</p>

Malheureusement les facultés administratives d'absorption se sont dév^oppéas avec non moins de rapidité et le muphte des naèttes disparaît toujonre avec une extrême facilité dans le gouffre des dépenses.</p>

Cette année les 16,000 livres d'augmentation de revenu lie leur ont apnaé aucun embarras. La somme intégrale a été- inscrite aux dépenses.</p>
                            <p>Dans de telles conditions, en supposant que l’augmentation oootinue graduellement et que les téoettes de 1906 dépassent 900,000 fines, on peut s'attendra à ee que oette tomme soit aagloatie de la “-“tra «vif in</p>
                            <p>Ce qui surprend davantage dans le budget de 1905, c’est que l'augmentation des dépensa ne provient pas d'une pin forte somma de travail aooempU par l'administration, puis presque uniquement d'une majoration, de traita mente du penonoaL II n’est pas are» intérêt à ce propos de rechercher la proportion qei «date entra le travail fourni par la Municipalité et Us émoluments qu’elle distribue à ara employés pour voir s’il y avait lieu d’opéwr cette majoration d’appointementei</p>

Il y aurait bien des observation* K taire sur quelques-unes Je cet dépenses, mais, pour ne pas nous écarter du but, nous les admettrons toutes comme étant complètement justifiées.</p>
                <p>Dans la'Quatrième catégorie,enfin, nous com­prenons tous les frais qui n’ont pu être classés dans les trois premières: 8,210 LE. pour lu nettoiement (fourrage 5,000 LE., etc.), 2,11  pour services sanitaires, 735 pour l’abattoir, 541 pour le musée et la bibliothèque ; soit un tqùd de LE. 11,596. Cette somme, elle aussi, ne ru présente aucun travail fourni par l'administra tion.</p>
                <p>eci une fois posé, rien n'est plus facile que d’établir la proportion entre le travail fourni par la Municipalité et les émoluments qu’ello distribue à son pcrsgiSÉ.ël.'ffi ijuffit pour cela de déduire du total; des dépenses les sommes payées par la caeto et les cfévenses diverses, soit un total d'en>ron 80,000 iÿjrca do dépenses qui n'ont aucun report s ver ïe personnel mu­nicipal. Reste uno sou—t fie 108,000 livres à partager entre le personnel, 50,000 livres, et le travail accompli, 58,000 livres.</p>
                <p>C’est donc en définitive une dépense de 50,000 livra pour un travail effectué de 58,000 livres.</p>
                <p>C’est absurde.</p>
                <p>Que dirait-on d’un entrepreneur qui, ayantri- faire un travail quelconque, consacrerait 30,000 livres aux matériaux et frais divers, 30,000 livres aux journaliers et 50,000 livres à son comptable f C'est pourtant dans cette propor­tion que l’administration municipale distribue les finances de la ville.</p>
                <p>On nous accusera peut-être de vouloir faire réduire les traitements du personnel Au con­traire, nous demandons qu'on augmente le personnel jugé nécessaire, mais qu’on supprime tous les emplois et rouages inutiles. On rédui­rait ainsi les fiais do plus de moitié et l'admi­nistration rien serait que meilleure.</p>
                <p>Pour qu’on ne nous accuse pas de partialité, nous allons donner une comparaison do détail. Les frais de nettoiement au Cuire ne dépassent pas 26,321 livres, tandis qu'à Alexandrie où lai surface bâjie est bien moindre et où les rues/ étant eu grande partie dallées ou asphaltées, demandent beaucoup moins d’entretien, ce même chapitre atteint 29,480 livres. La dif­férence, on le voit, est toute à l'avantage du Caire.</p>
                <p>Et remarque digue- d'intérêt, le chapitre du nettoiement est celui qui parait le moins sur­chargé de notre budget municipal.</p>
                <p>Nous terminons en disant que nous ne nous attendons pas à ce qu'il soit tenu le moindre compte des observations ci-dessus. Nous avons simplement voulu remplir un devoir de con­science : ouvrir les yeux uu publie.</p></div>

                    <p>Liverpool, December 22.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Cotton on the Spot has been freely offered this week, and with only a moderate enquiry, prices have been irregular, and quota­tions are reduced 3/16 per lb. except for "Fine Brown," which is only 1/16 per lb. lower.</p>
                    <p>Futures have been fairly active, and the following represent the closing values:</p>
                    <p>Jan. 6.22 Mar. 6.11 May. 6.7 July 6.6 </p>
                    <p> Feb. 6.15 Apt. 6.8 June 6.6 Aug.</p>
                    <p>American Futures. During the four days that the Market was open between the Christ­mas and New Year holidays, prices experienced a further very heavy and unexpected fall, amounting to about 45 points. This week there has been a sharp recovery of 30 points, but the improvement has only been partially main­tained. The fall was precipitated by the ginners’ report that 11,848,113 bales had been ginned up to 13th December, 1904, thus indicating a Crop of at least 12 1/2 @ 13 millions; rampant "Bear” manipulation and belated “Bull" liqui­dation intensified the depression. The Market is so beaten and disheartened that everyone fears a further decline, otherwise we should have discounted any crop that is likely to come into sight, for undoubtedly the South is hold­ing back cotton, and will continue to do so unless there is a material recovery in values. Also we shall shortly hear plenty of reports of considerably reduced planting which will pro­bably influence general sentiment, and restore confidence.</p>

                <head type="sub">THE TELEGRAPHISTS’ WAIL</head>
                <p>Tin- following petition lias lately been sent to the authorities at Cairo by the employes of the Telegraph- Administration :—
                    It is said that the Government through a note from tho Ministry of the Finance has promised to consider the complaints ol its lower grade employe1* with a view to alleviate the more glaring hardships in their unhappy lot.</p>
                <p>We. the employe* of the Telegraph Admi­nistration, would say tt>' the gentlemen who are to examine these grievances that in so far a' we are concerned they lieed tike very little trouble to discover the amplest justi­fication lor the statement that the condition of the Government's lower employes is of the most paiuful nature.</p>
                <p>The simplest thing to do would be for one of the said gentlemen to vi*it the telegraph office, Ezbehiehf/tvhere, before entering, he could hear with his own ears the groans and lamentations of the wretched employes. On entering he would see in their pal^ao#»*'^pd rounded shouldera,veritoble pictures of poverty and wretchedness. They cry Uoud in tbtv misery, but neither help nor support is for.^p coming. For a bug time now, we;-the employes of the office in Ezbekieh, Cairo, MausLlS, .Yiex., and other offices, who form the greater part of the administration, have been suffering under an ever-tucreasing weight of misery and slavery. We have waited with patience till we have found ourselves reduced to a condition the wretchedness of which could not fail to touch the hardest heart.</p>
                <p>We had always hoped that our administra­tion would some ‘lay be moved to pity and would come itself to our rescue, but our hopes haye-not been niuli-ed. Ou the contrary, we .Z, urselvcs treated with an incomprehensible akarice, as if we were the bitter enemies of the Mininistration and not its faithful and devoted /employes.</p>
                    <p>Each year the cost of living increases, rents ' have risen enormously, and though the earn­ings of our admiuistratiou have increased also, our salaries rernaiu ever, as before. Nothing has changed for us but general deterioration in health and destitution in our families.</p>
                    <p>The administration announces in the news­papers that it is in great need of probationers, but nobody responds to the demand. Each month the administration announces in its bulletin the names of se/eral persons who have resigned from the service and nobody replaces them.</p>
                    <p>Telegrams are delayed two, throe or lour hours, errors occur and complaints are constant­ly received from merchants and tradespeople. What does the administration do !</p>
                        <p>Whenever the number of employe* is in­sufficient it lengthens the hours of service lor the other* ; wheir an error occurs it imposes a fine . if one of us liands in his resignation it puts him off with promise' which are never fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>Is it not surprising that the administration should oblige the employe to make I row 200 to telegrams per day .' The blanks of every te­legraph from must be tilled in, causes of delay stared, etc. He must make a report of bis work for the service, noting hours, etc., which has to be entered again ou a special list. He has also to roll the slip, look over the telegram* in order to arrange them according to their times minute by minute, attend to the apparatus,etc.</p>
                        <p>All th/ ha> to be done under great pressure, anti i- it possible that no fault* nor delay oc cur ' Can an employe who works under sucb condition' be blamed if be invents au excuse for a delay that Way occur I Supposing All ern ployi1 endeavours t-. carry out this work con 'cietitioU'iy. what will be hi* condition mi \eav ing the office ’ After having worked as we' have detailed above for more ihoii eight hours, lie is titter to go to hospital than to go home.</p>
                        <p>This is what happens to us, for our exis­tence is passed between poor health and</p>
                        <p>The Medical Adviser of the administration ii'«d to grant us leave in case of illness, but even this practice of mercy ha* now been -topped, and we can only have leave if we aie in our last agony. It seems altogether inexcus­able that this Administration, which requires us to work under such difficult conditions, does no\ give us the necessary leisure for sleep and exeni-e, that we may regain our force* spent in the fatigue of night work; that it only allows us a quarter of an lour tor onr meals; that it deprive* us of all public holidays, giving ns even extra work ; that jt forbids us to take leave for reasons of health ; that it allows the greater number o! us to gn ou for five or six years with a salary of £3 W* cadre , that it iuqmses the most severe penalties for the least fault, and at the end of the year tells us that the budget ha* been reduced and, in consequence, there is for us neither augmentation nor reward.</p>
                        <p>Bad as is our condition in the service, it caunot be compared to our condition at home. The former is perhaps biown to our superiors, although they apjiear not to realise the nature of it, but the lattei can only be known to ourselves, who have to endure it.</p>
                        <p>The terrible rise in fhe "price of all kinds of provisions obliges us to pay double what We paid five yen* ago. Had we known that life for ns would be rendered impossible, we should not have married ; we should thus at least luive been spared the pain of seeing onr children in want</p>
                        <p>A salary of £7 per month is not sufficient to-day for a single man. How can it then suffice for the expenses of a family composed of father, mother and two children ? How can such a pittance I e made to meet rent food, clothes, school, doctor, etc ?

To wL„m then shall we complain ? We cntmt understand why the Government neglects tins' administration—an administration which was founded to aid the Government in its super­vision of the public security, to servo also the administrations of war, justice and the railways as well as to servo tho public—an administration whose object 1s to help deve­lop the trade and prosjterity of the country and which ovetuMbfcrt.) thd national revenue, this ^d^wtr^tSL that), is indispensable to the Government WHch 'would treat it accord­ingly.	^ 3</p>
                        <p>The objects of this letter is to ask the Govern­ment and the Administration to take into con­sideration the following demands, which, as everyone must recognise, cannot but make for the welfare of the Government, of the em­ployes, and of the public.</p>
                        <p>1	— To fix the commencing salary of the employe having his certificate at £5, as was formerly the case.</p>
                        <p>2	— To change the system of augmenta­tions so that an employe whose salary is under £10 be augmented by not less than £1.</p>
                        <p>3	— To diminish the hours of service to at most five or six hours per day, as in all other administrations, which enjoy, in addition to this daily leisure, Friday of each week and all the public holidays.</p>
                        <p>4 — To make good the augmentations which have been passed over, and to grant us the rights of which we have been deprived.</p>
                        <p>5	— To arrange the hours of service in such manner as to give us sufficient time to take our meals and our sleep, tliat we may not be obliged to eat during the service.</p>
                        <p>6	— To grant us our rights in regard to the usual leave fixed by decree for all the em­ployes of the government.</p>
                        <p>These are our demands, the execution of which, is of the most vital importance for ns. We pin our hopes on you, Sir, in your capacity
                            as	in order to have them taken into
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>If there be a delegation deputed to examine the conditio^ of the employes, we surely, above all, diserve that examination for we serve the Government, the public, and the loreign residents, to whom we render services (be utility of which cannot be denied, and which cannot be rendered by the employes of other administrations.</p>
                            <p>If there be pity for the lower employes, we, surely, above all, deserve it; our condition, both in tho office and at home, calls aloud for pity</p>

                    <p>To the Editor or the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In n leading article, which you recently published on the pilgrimage, you entirely left out of account the claims of thousands of ojr British-ludian subjects to protection. Bare­ly we ought also to consider the claims of these poor people to be protected from wrong­doing while in the performance of the great religious duty of their mortal lives. The task of keeping Arabia in subjection never has been and never cap h) earned out by the Bultau, whose authority ends at the coast towns. There is* moreover, very little likelihood that he would offer any serious resistance to our “peaceful penetration.” The loss of Arabia, though temporarily damaging to Ottoman prestige, would in tact consolidate Turkey's power by the loss of an unruly province. It therefore behoves our Government to step in for the purpose of checking the present dis­orders. Our present firm position in Egypt affords us a good opportunity for exercising our moral right, as a Power which numbers more Moslem subjects than any other in the world, to bestow some semblance of good government , on Arabia. We could do so without the interposition of any Christian, for we are educating a new generation of Egyptians and it would not be difficult to find a few capable Egyptian Moslems to police the country. We should first begin by the liudjaz, which, with a strong-mind­ed and firm Waly of our own appointing, backed up by some troops, would soon putjt stop to such terrible disorders as disgraced last year’s pilgrimage. It is certain that if we do not soon inaugurate a decisive forward policy in Arabia, some other Power wifi seize the opportunity. The manner in whi«h Persia has fallen under the influence of Russia should afford a salutary lesson in this respeot to even the purblind pundits of our Foreign (iffice.</p>

                    <p>To THE ElHTOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The figures given \by “Observer" ip yesterday’s issue of the "Egyptian Gazette” on the infant mortality prevailing ,jn Egypt, can only be characterised as appalling. When I read the letter of “Humanity,” drawing atten­tion to the remarkable statement contained in Mr. Lang Anderson’s article, 1 fully believed that that gentleman had been guilty ot\ slip of the pen. But the figures given in ye-iterttay’s “Gazette” from Dr. Engel Bey’s mortality statistics fully corroborate the miserable state of affairs. Surely there are statistics available fur the five years 1890 1895 and 1895-1900. Or is the Sanitary Administration 'so much occupied in framing Vexatious and j^jtty re­gulations for pharmacists, that it has no time to occupy itself with such matters I At home such a slate of affairs would immediately give rise to questions being asked in the House of Commons. But in Egypt the livee-of children are of insiguificant importance compared with irrigation problems. Are the Datives of Egypt so crass in their ignorance, that they!, care not ior this awful annual holocaust of human life 1 The Government ought onoo to publish a statement of tbfe latest statistics to band. If not, I hope that some philanthropist will take j up the matter in Englaud and call for a thorough enquiry. We have taken Egypt under our wing. In everything but ip name Eugland exercises a protectorate over this country. Are wo not then responsible in the j eyes of the world for this scandalous loss of life 1 The new year is only just beginning, and if Sir Horace Pinching and the other officials deserve to be entrusted with the so- called Sanitary Administration of this country, they should be told plainly that they must justify their continuance in offioe after 1905 has passed, by taking immediate step* to1</p><cb n="4"/>
                    <p>reduce the rate of infant mortality in the present year. Is such a request too much to make 1 Are they too much occupied iu making pleasant “inspection” trips up the Nile at this season of the year, to care whether or not public indignation has been aroused by Mr. Lang Anderson’s disclosures I The matter caunot be allowed to rest here, and it is a matter of conscience to Btir up official apathy on a subject of such vital importance. Of course, it is easy to foretell the attitude the Sauitary Administration will take up. We shall be told that it is all the fault of the natives ; that official interference can avail nothing, etc. Any excuse will do to escape being bothered. And all the while children are dying by hundreds and thousands </p>

                <p>What a lot of people there are “always ailing," but not sick enough -to keep to bed. How do you know them ?</p>
                <p>By their pale, sallow faces, dull eyes and hopeiess appearance, thin in face and body, and always aiaruieil at their condition.</p>
                <p>They will tell you their back aches, that their bead and umlw ache ; that they have no energy, are rheumatic, nervous, and irritable ; can't sleep, can t eat,.;-every little cold affects their back—they cough a little, and their heart acts strangeiy. They are generally miserable.</p>
                <p>Such people have kidney trouble, and don’t know it.</p>
                <p>Their illness is caused by weak kidney action. The Kidneys are clogged, and are keeping back in the body the uric acid and the iluid waste which cause urinary disorders! bladder troubles, bright s disease, and dropsy.</p>
                <p>Respondent as they are, it is difficult to convince them, and to get them to stop think­ing a5out'their ills.</p>
                <p>but a cure is sure and certain. Doan’s backache kidney pills will make them hearty and well, by keiping the kidneys to drive out the disease-causwg impurities from the body.</p>
                <p>This medicine is especially for kidney and urinary troubles, and can be relied upon as sale and certain. It does not open the bowels.</p>
                <p>For 7i years Doan's backache kiduey pills have beeu in use, and they are the tirst inediciue in the world lor kidney aud bladder troubles.
