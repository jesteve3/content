                            <p>The Tsar’s manifesto declares that the prevalent troubles have filled
                                his heart with great sorrow. These troubles may become a menace to
                                the integrity of the Empire, and it is therefore his duty to efface
                                himself, and to hasten their cessation. For this reason he
                                recognises that the co-ordination of the powers of government is
                                indispensable. Finally he directs the government to fulfil his will
                                as follows : (a) To grant real inviolability of person and freedom
                                of conscience, speech, union, and association. (b) Without deferring
                                the elections for the National Assembly, to enable, as far as is
                                possible on account of the shortness of the time, the classes at
                                present deprived of electoral rights to participate in the
                                elections, leaving the ultimate settlement of the franchise to the
                                new legislative regime. (c) To establish as an unchangeable rule
                                that no law shall come into force without the approval of the
                                National Assembly, which is also to exercise real supervision of the
                                legality of the acts of the authorities. A general strike begins in
                                    <placeName>Finland</placeName> to-day, which will include the
                                railways which have hitherto been unaffected. (Reuter )</p>

                            <p>The manifesto of the Tsar has been placarded throughout the City, and
                                telegraphed to wherever the lines are working. It is believed here
                                that the effect will be instantaneous. It created great popular
                                rejoicing yesterday evening. The crowds in the streets cheered for
                                liberty and the Tsar, singing the National Anthem instead of the
                                ‘'Marseillaise," as lately. The people surrounded the bewildered
                                    <placeName>Cossacks</placeName>, patting the horses and telling
                                the men to go home as they were no more needed, since they had
                                received their liberties. The strike is at an end on the
                                    <placeName>Moscow</placeName> and St. Petersburg, Moscow-Kazan,
                                and Moscow-Archangel railways. The jubilation caused by the first
                                announcement that the Tsar had granted a constitution was succeeded
                                to-day by demonstration in honor of the victory of the proletariat.
                                A huge procession waving red flags and singing revolutionary songs
                                paraded Nevsky Prospect. Hymns for the dead were sang at various
                                points in memory of the victims of the 22nd January. The
                                processionists halted at the University, where workers and students
                                joined in making speeches declaring that the manifesto showed the
                                powerlessness of the autocracy. The victory of the people has, been
                                enthusiastically celebrated in the provincial centres by processions
                                and thanksgiving services. The Governor of Odessa appeared amidst
                                the crowd in front of the palace, and congratulated them on their
                                victory. The crowd demanded the release of political prisoners and
                                the removal of the Cossacks. The Governor promised to comply.

                                <placeName>Fayoum</placeName>, were noticed by some natives who
                            endeavoured to check them. Both parties exchanged shots, one man being
                            killed and two ghaffirs slightly wounded. The

                        invaluable gift of being able to accompany well. He adapts himself to the

                        <p>During the Khedive's recent visit to Constantinople his Highness had a
                            conference with the <persName>Sultan</persName> on the subject of the
                            Island of Thasos, which has unjustly been seized by the Sublime Porte.
                            The Sultan has recently instituted a Kaimakamat on the Island, whioh has
                            since become the fourth Sandja’k of the vilayet of
                                <placeName>Salonica</placeName>. To-day there is a mutassarifat, a
                            tribunal, and an organised gendamerie on the Island. The Khedive has a
                            chateau then and possesses various estates and farms on the Island, as
                            well as large plantations. The forests are being exploited by a
                            German-Jewish company. This German company wants to exploit all the
                            mines on the Island, and their application is under consideration. The
                            report that the Germans have been allowed to have a coal depot on the
                            Island and to use it as a naval station is inexact. The Germans have not
                            got so far, but the Sultan is getting more under the thumb of Germany
                            every day, and the influence of the Germans is increasing in
                            Constantinople enormously owing to the ellipse of prestige. The Sultan
                            will soon be a mere tool in the hands of the Kaiser, whose clever policy
                            in <placeName>Turkey</placeName> has done so much for the development of
                            German trade and influence. </p>

                        <p>The Khedivial yacht Mahroussa is now in the Govan dry-dock, where <persName>Messrs.
                            Inglis</persName> are altering the stern for the turbine propellers. The turbine
                            machinery and boilers are on board, the funnel is set up, and the
                            mainmast in position. Workmen are busy laying the shade deck and
                            erecting the other deck structures. When our representative paid a visit
                            to the vessel recently in Messrs. Inglis's yard, he found from 500 to
                            600 men busily employed on the yacht, with <persName>Mustapha Pasha Ibady</persName> and <persName>Mr.
                            Taylor</persName>, the chief engineer, engaged in superintending the details of the
                            work. The vessel, although not by any means nearly finished, had been
                            completely changed, and was quite unrecognisable. There was, of course,
                            no trace of the old paddles, and the old wooden bow had been replaced by
                            a steel one. The new machinery takes up half the room previously
                            unoccupied, and the space thus economised is being utilised for the
                            erection of rooms for the Khedive’s suite. New deck houses are being
                            erected, including a spacious dining saloon, captain’s room, and smoking
                            room, while on the new boat deck there will be a room for his Highness
                            and the chart room. It is expected that the Mahroussa will not leave the
                            shipbuilders’ hands until the month of April or May next, as a good deal
                            remains to be done in the way of fittings, etc. When put to sea again
                            she will be capable of a speed of 17 knots.</p>

                            of the Accounts Department from LE. 40 to LE. 60 per month, and that of
                            the inspector of the same service from LE 40 to LE 50 per month.</p>

                        <p>The current number of the “Spectator" concludes an interesting article on
                            the criminal rat with the following remarks on the Alexandrian variety:—
                            It is one of the curiosities of animal temperament that while the brown
                            rat is so universally detested, the closely related Alexandrian rat—the
                            white or piebald varieties are well known in this country—is almost a
                            favourite. It is a very quiet, docile little animal, almost affectionate
                            in its relations with man, and constantly kept as a pet by children. It
                            is clean and very gentle, never by any chance offering to bite, and is
                            as intent on storing up food, as if it had never forgotten the
                            experience of its ancestors in the "lean years” when <persName>Joseph</persName> ruled under
                            <persName>Pharaoh</persName>. It is the humblest of all domestic pets but often quite
                            interesting in its ways, the only drawback to its company being the
                            close resemblance in appearance to the criminal brown rat.</p>

                        <head>EGYPT IN PARLIAMENT.</head>
                        <head>NATIVE PRESS OPINION.</head>
                        <p>“Al Moayad" recently published an article of which the following is a
                            summary. “In his speech of last June Lord Cromer stated that Egyptian
                            questions should always be kept distinct from the varying policies of
                            the British political parties. Yet we have seen in the parliamentary
                            reports of last August some comments on Lord Cromer's statement. <persName>Mr. H.
                            Weston</persName>, M.P., asked the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on
                            the 8th August last, whether the administration of Egypt by Lord Cromer
                            would be taken under the control and responsibility of the British
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, to which <persName>Lord Percy</persName> replied that the
                            administration of Egypt was entrusted to the Khedive and his Ministers,
                            acting with the guidance and aid of Lord Cromer as the responsible
                            Diplomatic Agent of H. M.’s Government In reply to another question Lord
                            Percy said that the Egyptian Government most pay attention to Lord
                            Cromer’s advice. "The placing Egypt under the direct supervision of the
                            British Parliament will have, as far as we see, to be freshly
                            considered. As for ourselves, we should like our Government to be under
                            parliamentary superintendence,provided, the latter is efficacious and
                            unchangeable. The officials of the Occupation in that case would become
                            very careful in their acts, and be obliged to give an account of them to
                            their superiors. But it will be necessary for Parliament to obtain
                            reports about Egypt from an Egyptian source, because the British reports
                            will contain nothing against the Occupation, as is the case with Lord
                            Cromer’s annual report. "The Egyptians most understand their real
                            position after 28 years of occupation, and after the occupying Power has
                            come into close partnership with Egypt in possessing the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, where
                            <placeName>England</placeName> cares very little for her partner, and also after the
                            Anglo-French Agreement Let us put aside the useless words “ocoupation"
                            and “withdrawal" as all efforts in this direction of imagination and
                            fancy will be in vain. Let us look at our present state and do our best
                            to keep something of our station and strive for our possible advantage.
                            We had better deal with the British authorities in our social questions
                            and come with them to a useful understanding. If one requirements in
                            some way could not be answered, we should do our best to bring the
                            unsolved matters before Parliament. Now is the proper time for the
                            communication. A member of Parliament itself opens a door for us to
                            enter, and we must seize the opportunity in seeking a Parliamentary
                            supervision over Egypt. Let us turn the demand into notion in good time,
                            while we have such a straightforward representative as Lord Cromer, who
                            possesses the necessary requirements and acts even if it is against
                            himself. We had better do this before some other people put difficulties
                            in our way." This article having given rise to some misunderstanding,
                            <persName>Sheikh Aly Youssef</persName>, proprietor of “Al Moayad," has informed “Al
                            Mokattam" that it was not meant that Egypt should have any official
                            relation with the British Parliament “Al Moayad" only wishes the
                            Egyptians (says “Al Mokattam") to put before some M.P., who is or might
                            be known to them, all the questions which they wish to come directly
                            before Parliament.</p>

                        advantage After a few minutes play, Boulac, by their forwards tricky

                        difficult angle. More goals were scored, and at half-time the soon stood at
                        3-0 in Boulac's favor. On the resumption of play the A. S. Corps started
                        with great-dash and determination, and their forwards’ efforts were crowned
                        with a goal, neatly shot by <persName>Williams</persName>. Gradually the home forwards began to
