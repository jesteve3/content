                    <p>"Tho Schoolmaster," says Lord Cromer in his last report, “is abroad." II y a fagot* el fagoti, said Molifcre in his “Quack Doctor" now a good many years ago. The quack doctor is well nigh dead, even the quack phar- macien is dying, but the schoolmaster (the quack and the honest man) is still “abroad." The dangers of quack drugs and of quack doctors are so glaing, we feel " the smart so nearly, that their day is short They stand condemned by the very loudness of their voioe; but the pretended schoolmaster pipes in softer and more insidious tones. Who shall distinguish between the true and the false—“blind mouths that scarce themselves know to hold a sheep-hook 1 For the philoso phy of education we liave in these harried days no time, but the secoud annual report of that interesting educational experiment, the Viotoria College at Alexandria, deserves some consideration aud we have published the report in full in to-day’s issue. A perusal the report brings to mind a recent article in the Paris “Figaro” entitled “L’Usine britan- nique," frem the pen of the Baron Pierre de Coubertin. “The British Factory” is a title which Daturally suggests a discussion of labour questions; bnt the iugenuous reader who may have begun his perusal of this parti­cular article under the influence of that sug­gestion will speedily have found himself mis­taken. M. de Coubertin, a Frenchman who evidently has something of the likiug tor, aud knowledge of, KugUnd that Mr. J. B. C. Bodley has with regard to Franoe, meant something quite different His “British Faotory” is the English public school, and the preoise cause of his artiole in the “Figaro" was a recent pnblio utteranoe of Dr. Peroral, Bishop of Hanford,</p><cb n="5"/>
                    <p>and sometime Headmaster, successively, of Clifton aud Rugby. Not to many men is it given to preside over two of our great public schools, aud that reason alone would suffice to command very special attention to what Dr. Percival may have to say. The ex-Headmaster com­plained of the poverty of the intellectual results attained by the English public schools, and declared himself convinced of the necessity ol a total reform of the system of instruction which at present prevails in them. To put tbs case shortly, Dr. Percival thinks that too much attention is paid to the development of brawn, and too little to that of brain. Now, here comes in, precisely, the peculiar interest of the views of M. de Coubertin. A French writer, imbued, presumably, with the theories embodied in the dreary educational system of the French “Ly- c,” might have been expected to adopt with enthusiasm the “flannelled fool" and “muddied oaf’ theory, and to have but scant sympathy with a system which makes the "games master ’ an important factor in public school life. But not at all. M. de Coubertin has the root of the matter in him, and he sees clearly that Tho­mas Arnold, to whom he pays au eloquent tribute of admiration, was right in regarding the supreme end of publio school life to be, as the Prenoh would put it, not Cinstruction, but / education. Arnold, says M. de Coubertin, evolved out of a state of chaos “uno usine de force sooiale"— a factory of social energy, which energy was to be used in the service of the nation and the Empire.</p>
                    <p>If we are not much mistaken, this French­man has “touched the spot." In a masterly passage he describes how the “graud peda­gogue” “created school in the image of society, and made school life the first chapter in social life.” M. de Coubertin sees clearly tho great gulf which divides the English* from the Con­tinental school. The English public school is a- microcosm—the Contiuental school is merely a cramming shop. Why I What is the difference! The difference is that the English system teaches responsibility—the other does not. An English pnblio school, with its various out­lets for energy, its games, its debating society and other societies, its school magaxiue, and its large liberty within reasonable limits, gives a lad a foretaste of the part he will play on the larger stage of life, and teaches him to play it. Above all, there is that pecnliarly English institutiou, the prefecional, or monitorial, system which, in return lor oertain privileges, makes the head boys of proved authority aud charaoter answerable tor the good conduct and the wellare of their juniors. “I should bo very sorry," says M. de Coubertin, "for the Englishman who “should be blind enough not to perceive that "such institutions are not ouly the glory^l his “school system, but form one ol toe founds- “tions of his prosperity.” Such au education, when applied to those capable of receiving it— and to those who are incapable of receptivity all education must be useless—is, as he ad­mirably puts it, "un apprentissage de la liberty.” That is not to say that no improve­ment is possible in matters of detail ; mdeed, it is obvious that headmasters must be con­stantly on the watch for weak spots in the system, as revealed to them iu the ever-shift­ing light ol social and intellectual progress. But, broadly speaking, the public school sys­tem is absolutely healthy, inasmuch as it coincides with, and expresses, that political and social system ol ordered freedom under which Englishmen live, and inculcates those lessons of responsibility which give English­men their unique capacity for ruling.</p>
                    <p>Whatever changes Dr. Percival would like to see, we caunot believe that he would desire any essential alteration of the publio school system. “Nobody in England—among those whose opinion oounts’’—says M. de Coubertin, "seeks to destroy that. Nobody wants to borrow from the Coiitiueut its scholastic prisons, iu arbitrary discipline, iu meihoti-- of distrust aud elpionnage." Tba^ is so; but we esteem it a high Vsompliment to\hear it from a foreigner. The public school system has, no doubt, the defects of its1 qualities; but iu qual­ities are a national asset of which to be proud. We ought, therefore, to be gmleiul to a foreign publicist who pays spontaneous tribute to a peculiarly English institution.</p></div><cb n="6"/> </div>

                        <p>Port Arthur has fallen, and so have Russian Stocks—had it not been for the efforts of in­terested parties Russian fours would now be below 90. There were reports on ’Change this morning to the effect that the coming loan of £25,000,000, mentioned in our last, is to be postponed ; there is no doubt that the financial strain is making itself severely felt, and if the struggle in the Far East is continued much longer, the resources of more than one of the Powers will be required to prevent a serious falling away from present prices. The latest news as to the coming issue is to the effect that Russian financial authorities have decided to reduce the amount asked for in Germany to £16,000,000 — no doubt at the instigation of those who have undertaken the burden of finding the money. The bait to the under­writers is a substantial one, namely 4 1/2% com­mission, in other words, they get the stock, which it will be remembered carries interest at 4 1/2%, at 90 1/2, the issue price being 95. As regards the prospects of peace, we are assured that these are better to-day than they have been for some weeks past. The Russian people want an honorable peace and are beginning to make themselves heard in earnest. France is moving heaven and earth to help them to this end, and all the other great Powers are ready to lend a helping hand, so if the various Russian factions can only settle their differences it will not be long before the last gun in Manchuria is fired. The markets since the New Year have been somewhat disappointing. Dealers had one and all made up their minds we were to see a good recovery all round, and a large number had backed their opinions by buying stock dur­ing the last account of the year. This professional speculative buying is in itself a weak factor when outside business is on so small a scale as it has been of late. Another point tending to check any upward movement is the fact that Germany was a heavy seller during the early part of the week of speculative stocks in gene­ral and Kaffirs in particular. This may be accounted for by the feeling in Berlin as to the forthcoming issue of Russian stock referred to above. Egyptian stocks have kept clear of the general dull tone and there has been a sharp recovery in price under the lead of National Banks, which were as high as 24 bid early in the week, and are now 4 $ buyers. Agriculturals  are firm again at 9 7/8 buyers, and Daira shares are almost up to 22. Salt and Soda took a fresh start yesterday at 2, and look strong again at that figure. Delta Lands have recov­ered to 3 1/2 premium The buying comes from your side and it looks as if Egypt were trying force prices against London, but there is no to open Bear account here although there is not much stock about. The shares of the Corpora­tion of Western Egypt—dealings in which have commenced since our last — have been in fair demand at 5/8 @ 3/4 premium, but the market is only a nominal one involving negotiations if it is a question of more than a few shares. Egyptian mining shares are dull again with Kaffirs. Their definite recovery depends for the present on the activity of the mining section generally. Nile Valley close at 2 1/4 buyers and United Africans at 1 3/4, with not much doing in either.</p></div></div><cb n="2"/>

                        his office from early in 1897 to November 29, 1904. Deceased was an architect working under the Bureau du Comite des Monuments Arabes. Witness had been ill, and alter returning from Helouan on the 26th November last, found a letter from deceased tendering his resignation. He knew of no reason for this. He had received two letters from the deceased in which he excused himself for non attendance at the of­fice, giving various excuses, followed by a formal letter of resignation. He saw the de­ceased, who gave no reason and merely said that he was going to Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Questioned by the jury, witness stated that he bad not been altogether satisfied with de­ceased's work, and quoted several cases in which he had been forced to reprimand him for omissions and negligence of orders. On the last occasion deceased said he would comply with the spirit if not the letter of his in­structions. He had previously written to Dr. Sierra, an uncle of the deceased, more than once. On this occasion, when he returned to the office, which had been in deceased’s charge during absence of witness, certain things had not been done, and the clerks said they would resign if deceased was put in charge again. After bringing deceased’s conduct before the committee he wrote to Dr. Sierra, saying that he wished to speak to him about a relation. In reply to the question as to who it was, contained in Dr. Siena’s answering letter, be wrote and put the facts before him, but on receiving deceased’s letter tendering his re­signation he wired to Dr. Sierra to consider witness’s second letter as null. His report to the committee and complaints to Dr. Sierra could not have been known to deceased before be gave his resignation. Deceased’s salary was L.E. 22 ; he began at L.E. 13.</p>
                    <p>The jury brought in a verdict of suicide from despair, on which Mr. Alban, who was presiding over the inquest, asked them to consider whether deceased was compos mentis or not when he committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>The jury retired for consideration and gave a verdict of “suicide while deceased was not responsible for his actions, owing to despair at his non-success in his profession.”</p></div>

                        <p>The Sirdar, Sir P.R. Wingate, K.C.B.,D.S.O., has just completed five years in command of the Khedive's troops, but it has been ruled that his case does not come under the provi­sions of the Royal Warrant. Be that as it may, it is certain that his removal from the head of the Egyptian Army would be a great mistake, and the Army Council was well advised in sanctioning his continuance in command.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>In March Major General John R. Slade, C.B., will vacate the command of the British Amy in Egypt From accounts to hand from Cairo, the approaching retirement of the gallant gunner is contemplated with much regret by all ranks, for he has ever been popular with his subordinates and superiors, anno domino being his only enemy. His field services, we need hardly remind our readers, included that black day at Maiwand, where his noble devotedness largely went towards saving the British guns.</p></div>
                    <div type="item"><p>Major Alexander Mattei, Royal Malta Artillery, has just been promoted Lieutenant- Colonel commanding the regiment, one company of which is stationed at Alexandria. Lieutenant-Colonel Mattei, who replaces Colo­nel Antonio Gatt, retired, joined the regiment in November, 1870, and has held field rank for the past twelve years. He holds the medal and Khedive’s star for service in the Egyptian War of 1882.</p></div>

                    <div type="item"><p>It has been decided that the 3rd and 4th Battalions added to the Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, Royal Fusiliers, Lancashire Fusiliers, Worcestershire Regiment, Middlesex Regiment, and the Manchester Regiment in the past few years, will be gradually reduced, and also the five battalions of the Royal Garrison Regi­ment. So far as is practicable the officers will be transferred to other regiments. On the other hand, the establishments of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade are to be increased.</p></div>

                        <p>Yesterday's races deserved a better attendance, for though the weather was rather raw | in the morning, in the afternoon the wind fell and the weather remained quite warm till about 5 p.m., when a little rain fell. Lord and Lady Cromer and Lady Beatrice Thynne were present at the races and among the other spectators were Major-General Slade, C.B., Coles Pasha, Mr. Webb, C.M.G., Lady Rogers, Mme. Adolphe Cattani, Hon. and Mrs. Davey,
                            Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Higgins, Col. Aylmer Johnson Pasha, Mr. P. Machell, Mr. P. de Martino, Ishak Bey Hussein, Omar Bey Sultan, and many other well-known residents. Visitors were curiously scarce.</p>
                            <p>The racing gave some very good finishes, especially in the 4th and 5th races, which were  excellently fought. In the 4th race Fitz only just beat Mizzaud, while in the 5th Starboard Light showed remarkable staying powers, just getting home past such good horses as Sir Visto and Latiff. A very unfortunate accident happened in the 2nd race, Saleh Bey Cherif's new horse, Sans Pretention, stumbling and breaking its off foreleg while rounding the turn. Khalil Pasha Khayat again did well and got two firsts, while Mr. Tueni’s Voyageur, though he, as usual, failed to win; ran quite well and was 2nd in the Novices’ Stakes. Mr. Sursock and Mr. Karam were again unlucky.</p>

Starboard Light soon overtook Tahawi, and the two were together till more than halfway, when Latiff coming up challenged and passed Starboard Light and came into the straight alongside of Tahawi. The race seemed between these horses, and so the jockeys appeared to think, for Jenkins just cleared El Tahawi in the last 200 yards but had no attention to spare to Starboard light, who came up again on his off side and running grandly won by hall-a-length. La tiff was 1/2 a length ahead of El Tahawi.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>TIJK COMING OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>'.Tho material progress made in Egypt (lyr iugtbo lost twenty years, bus certainly been remarkable.” So wrote lord Croiuer to the Martinis of Lanxlownu in his last otlu-iul repofc on the tinanees, administration, an t condition if Egypt and the Sudan. And the accuracy of the statement-will, I think* l>o amply b .me out by the far-seeing financiers whose uauic- and reputation* are so closely identified with the advance of this highly favored territory. wLioh may now be regarded as within the coniines of the British Empire. But satisfied »> Lord Crouier undoubtedly is with the past, he looks forward to still more ambitious develop meals, and does not hesitate to tell its thnt "a far greater degree of prosperity is attainable in. the future.” Naturally, however, with so vain able a possession very special core must betaken nottio launch out too quickly or without due consideration. A false step at this stage might mean, if not disaster, at any rate-a set-back. Accordingly we find Lord Cromer insisting on the utmost care being taken not to embark on auy schema involving heavy expenditure until all the facts connected with tile matter are fully examined anddi cusa-'.d. N»one acquaint-, ed with Egjpt is likely to find fault with this policy. But wliilujfMUtiou is to be the natch word in opening tip the country, there is no intention of allowing things, to stagnate, aud as soon as Lord Cromer is convinced of the neces­sity and the feasibility of any project} he does not hesitate to advise the Egyptian Govern1 meat to adopt a policy of financial baldness in the direction of spending capital. This was the coofse pursued iu the construction of the Nile reservoirs, aud the same plan was! followed, with respect to the Suakin-Bexber Railway.. A similar policy has ..Vky*'ien adopted with regard to the many, demands' yor mi*ing con­cessions ill Egyjt and the •' -,'u lau , received daring the past tjo years. Wiile no obstacle* are allowed to be placed in, me way:of legiti­mate commercial enu: ,; e*s{ the mere company prouiotor is rigidly excluded. ThatLotUCromer has experienced no small difficulty in attain­ing both these objects will be easily understood, And that be has done sods a further proof of his great power as art administrator. Not only have the interests of the Egyptians themselves been his care, but by means of the policy ha- has so wisely, adopted he has also safeguarded the iuterests of the investor. His knowledge oi finance, however, has not led him into driving hard bargains; it is the genuineness of the transaction that has been ever present to. his mind, not the desire to coerce his clients info making a purchase which handicaps profits. For instance, he fully recognises that so highly a speculative business as miuing cannot be carried to a successful issue unless a large</p><cb n="1"/>
                    <p>margin of profjt is loft to the prospiotor. His 1 mission is to encourage mining enterprise, not ' to repel it by extortionate demands and exas­perating conditions.</p>
                    <p>__ JBSCEPTIONAL RESOURCES.</p>
                    <p> Nearly all the Egyptian territory j lying ' be­tween the Nile uud the Kod Sea ha-* now been allotted, in areas of.different sinea,|to private j syndicates. A rent of L.E. 2 an acre jfa charged , Ou the area taken up for winiug purposes; and a royalty of one-tenth, is levied on the annual j distributable profits arising under; or in oonnec l tiou with, the oonoession, but in the caLso of j prospecting fur col half the-above rent onlyis asked, aud the Government takes no share in the profits of the. undertaking, sincejit is well understood what an . immense advantage it would be to the country if coal iiiiaderjOate quantity oduld be found in Egypt or the Sudan. Yet while Lord Cromer lias been carry-' itig out. this Very oonsiilontble. tfunster of mineral-bearitig property, apart froi* the’poli- tjcal classes and they financiers -vyho have become the fortunate purchasers, thej majority of British people still apear tolqok ion Egypt as a country’ of deserts and pyramids? The ordinary British iuvostor is in iftifomaoe of the wealth awaiting his attention. He probabl/ kuows nothing of the reoent treaty ' arrange­ment with France,, and associates the Egypt of to-day with'the vagaries experienced in the past, rather than .with tbs firm administration qfLqwb,Cromer. It is time, then,j for the to take hie part in the dewslopment of.«Nmno’ whioh. in resource ia like^ to rival Indik-^Mfllions of acres of the roost productive •oil are ^waiting irrigation, and thiir pros­pective value may be gauged by (the large acreage already possessing this advantage. Egypt proper pays ita expenses and the interest -ou its-Uopt* and with the passing of tHe French Trp *ty a goodly portion ol the yearly surplus will be released for use on public undertakings, such a# new railways, port*, oanals, and harbour works. The Sudan ia fast racoyeringjfrom the ravages of tfio Mahdi, but funds ana aorely needed for development purposes. Aij yet.it is only by the most rigid economy that if is fonnd possible to make both ends meet. Thd Dongola Froviooe has a very large acreage suitable for ootton-growing — the banks of the Vfhite and Blue Niles will grow almost anything — while -ill for Bahr-el-Ghazal we. have a province whioh arouses even the enthusiasm of the native. All who know Egypt see the great difference ia the peasant population during the last few years. Even-handed justice is now a certainty. The Arab tribes are becoming accustomed to British rule, and are quick ^ to grasp the truism that peace means wealth and war spells poverty. Each year as the; country opens up Bedouin, Bishareen, and Hedei wa come into contact with Europeans au- ose</p><cb n="2"/>
                        <p>their dosire for fighting and robbery. In lhfed ' G6neral Gordon told us that “ the Sudan is a worthier possession, ever was so, and ever will be so.” This view was also enter­tained byi Colonel Stewart Time and British influence, have changed allptbis, and Lord Cromer, is of opinion “that without indatiring a charge, of excessive optimism it may be anticipated that, with a judicious expenditure of oapital and the continuous application of a system of government inch as that whioh is: now very skilfully directed by Sir Reginald Wingate and hie stall’, the future of the country will be far less gloomy than was predicted by these two > high authorities.” There is no doubt that the difficultiee in the way of extending the cultivable area of • the Sudan, though considerable, will be over­come in time ; -while the objections which tho -Egyptians now entertain again.vt emigra­tion to that country- will probably disappear under the influonoe of an improved admini­stration.</p>

                    <p>lugoldsby.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the tint number of the new publication, •Urieut and Occident," a short notice of which appeared in the “Ga/etto’’a tew days ago, there was printed an abstract of an address given on “The Drink Question in Egypt.”</p>
                    <p>Now 1 have been thinking, since.living in Egypt, that the country is fortunate in having no serious problem in. that direction to grapple with. That it is not, so far, an urgent question is admitted in the address referred to, for the speaker expressly stated that crime resulting from drunkenness is so infrequent as not to be separately tabulated in criminal statistics,—a very satisfactory state of affairs indeed. Why then bring the question into prominence at the present time 1</p>
                    <p>The answer to this was that one should take warning by Murthero Europe, and, by the adoption of preventive measures, guard against a similar state of things in Egypt coming abotft. Methods to insure this were suggested, and here it is that important considerations present themselves.</p>
                    <p>It needs but a short residence in Egypt to convince the most casual observer that excess in drinking here and in England are two quite different things, aud that while in Ureat Britain the evil is one with which it is difficult to cope, in Egypt, if you could eliminate one or two drinking sections aud the immoral classes, there would be little ground for the temperance reformer to work on.</p>
                    <p>This, 1 think, is mainly to bo attributed to the lar greater facilities that pemde in this country possess for purubas^ getfa liquor, either m 'mail or large qtyjbttties anfthe almost total absence of tbjl public-lion^ bar, where a false appetite aud^raving is Educed by the sale ot inferior aud hdulUya^SI liquor.</p>
                    <p>No doubt inferior liquor is very often sold in Egypt, but the opportunities for purchasing smalt quantities of, say, the best Scotch whiskies and Coutipenta! brandies at respectable grocery aud provision stores, aud of consuming wine, beer, aud spirits under reasonable conditions, must greatly teud to keep down the drunkenness that would, I ieel sure, ensue if English licensing laws and brewers’ control of me trade took the place of — the freedom given in this country, aud public houses replaced the open-air cates.</p>
                    <p>It somewhat amused me to notice in passing the wiudow ot a lngti-class stationer's shop a group ol bottles ol brandy marked “Occasion, B.T. 1», "although it is as good au illustration ot the liicilitles ottered tor tlic purchase of alcoholic liquors as oue'could wish to hud. Vet one seldom, iHiver, sees a drunken mau in the streets of Alexandria '</p>
                        <p>So in the advocacy ot temperate habits out here, there does not appear to be the need ot enforcing the prim^ple of total abstineuce that is, in so many casts in England, the ouly real cure for thet^nl ot intemperance. Nor should the tempera'*) man who is not a total abstaiuer bo the mark tor the temperance relurmer.</p>
                        <p>For by the evidence he gives that it is possible to use what he, at least, considers to be; the good things ot life without abusing them, lie enforces the lesson ol moderation in a manner that would carry much greater weight with many people than if he placed himself under restriction "fur the sake of example.'</p>
                        <p>In saying this I am dealing with the question t’r uii an abstract aud general, rather than an individual point ot view, entirely omitting the very moot point as to whether a moderate consumption of alcohol is. or is not, harmful to the constitution. 1’ossibly it is harmful to some,</p><cb n="1"/>
                        <p>but at tho same time it may be beneficial to others, and it mast be left to the individual to be guided by his own experiences. My own go to show that after beiqg a total abstaiuer for some 8 or 9 years, I tiud that now a little light wi::o daily is good.ibr me.</p>
                        <p>But that doesriiot hinder me from advocating teiuppwncifpnnciples, or in any way lessen my seiise of tho evils of excess. Seeing, therefore, that in Egypt we have no workhouses, prisons, and lunatic asyliims^half-filled with victims of drink, and (that no symptoms of national decadence from that cause are as yet apparent, 1 am iuclincd to the opiuion that tv total abstinence crusade, or even the dissemination of teetotal literature just mow, would do little if any. real good.</p>
                        <p>As regards the natives, the question stands on an entirely ditfeVent footing. While such a powerful bjdy a» the ChurcB of England Temperance Society upholds the strictly moderate use of alcoholic liquors, the Koran, on the other hand, positively torbids their Nuse by all Mobawedaiis, aut^ it should be ti comparatively easy task to show tbem that their religion docs not sauction tho drinking o. wines, beer, or spirits.</p>
                        <p>But good . people who seek to proselytise should bear in mind that if they win over the Moslems to the Christiau faith, they will place in their hands a' book that contains the words- “Take a little wine for thy stomach’ sake,” an(^they*might find themselves "on the Boms of adnamii^:'’</p>
                        <p>Like all griat questions, what is known as the temperance one wauts lookiug at from more than one point of view, and not only as regurds drink is temperance necessary, but equally in respect to eating, smoking, and other things that are carried to excess by many people who arc immaculate on oue given point. Sometimes a tendency is shown to</p>

                    <p>A London contemporary makes the following remarks on the news that the Suez Cauai Company-, at its annual meeting in June, will be informed of a new tariff, reducing the dues by 3d. a ton.:</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether made voluntarily, or thrown as a sop to shipowners, the Reduction will be very welcome ; aud wo hope it may bo followed by frmhef/oues. it is true that a rate of 8s. 9d., charged when the Canal was opened, will, it the news be accurate, have fallen alter June 16 6s. 8d. ; but there is a widespread and very reasonable tceling that the Canal has too much the aspect of au international convenience to be made a source of great profit to shareholders. Certainly cheap rates would be of mure advantage to British trade than any other ; and soon tho opening up of the Far East may make the matter urgeut. The leading malcontents point out that at the conference ol British shippers convened by the late M. de Lesscps iu 1833, the Company pledged themselves to a live-penny reduction of dues for every lucrease of dividend by 1 per cent.; and the reduction now contemplated lias been delayed a year. That is a smalt matter. The Canal should be wider and cheaper; and whether the shipowners’ project of a duplicate channel be carried out in rivalry or otherwise, something bold must soon be done.</p></div><cb n="2"/>

                    <p>The "Manchester’Guardian," in ita review of the Jiiip’.iVi cotton, trade in 1904, makes the following remarks on Egyptian cotton:—.
                        
                        The variations in the price of Egyfcjian cotton have been, of course, determined in iome measure by the course of prices in Amfepcan cotton, and we havo seen that the hig Seat prices ••f the season in both kinds wWtf otneident. The differences in the relation of >fie to the other have been nevertheless, remark ble. Good fair Egyptian opened the'yeak at 8{j 1/ and on February 2, the highest point of the year, the difference between middling America! and good fair Egyptian was a trifle more than l£d. Daring the summer months the ttiflferen » sank to Jd. and even less, and spranewfwhi Had been accustomed to produce Hue count* of American turned in some cases to Egyptian col on. During tbo last mouth or two, howeypr. he difference widened again, and is now ab it 3d. per lb. Tho Egyptian crop of 1904-3 peem i likely to be something of a disappointment. The previous crop was 6,508,947 cantors, Aid with a itook in Alexandria on August 31  f 409,000 cantors and good acoounts ot the ne’ crop low prices seemed probable. The estimi tee, how-r, have dropped gradually from omething use 7,000,000 can tore to bandy SOoiuOO, and with/the Liverpool market lately »low the parity of Alexandria thert has tfehn imething like a shortage of the staple. The de ention of cotton by Egyptian speculator* has be in assigned in some quarters as the chief ca se of the high prices, and a further resdft to s mrt time, by spinners is suggested. The'ftBe of Egyptian cotton has naturally decreased, and w ire it not that some of the spinners of the c immoner counts of Egyptian have been able I > turn to American counts' the particular brar ;h of the iudustry would have been in a ver difficult position. Prices of Egyptian cotton! have, or course, fallen id Correspondence with American, and though during November they /ere usually quoted in Liverpool as “nominal,y Decem-oer brought a more definite condition,Jiuduced, perhaps, by a more moderate demaid. And while, on tho «ne hand, Egyptian coiton has sometimes the effect ot casing thl higher grades of American, Surats are more closely related to the lower grades. ’ It seems hrobuble, however, that with a full supply of American cotton the East Indian crop will nof seem '*a matter of first-rate interest to Lancashire'spinners, but reports of both quantity an| quality seem fairly good. The Continental demand is expected to be ouly moderate this season, and most indications point to low prices. The year’s experience seems to show, howeVer, that Indian cotton may be a valuable auxiliary, especially to a short American crop, ahd those who are interested in it believe thai -Indian cotton has a great future before it. There is not rniirli definite information about! tho various other crops which have considerable, if obscure, influence on the geiieral {xy-ition, though the prospects of Russian Asiatic ootton are said to be good. There will be nixt year, of course, various small subsidiary supplies due to the energy of the British aiid other cotton-growing associations, and thdse, too, form an incalculable factor ill the* general sitjintioif.</p></div>

                    <head type="sub">MR. COOKSON’S POEMS.</head>
                    
                    <p>Egypt has inspired the best of the hoe ms in I, this little book, and our readers will'not, we hope, blame us if we confine ourselves |u far as possible, in this review, to verses that deal with . things which we all havo seen and kndw. The 8phinx, the Nile, the sights afid bounds of Egypt, are all familiar to us, and vdrse that makes them its subject has a more gcheral interest. And soma of Mr. Cookson’si verse is very good, though there is a certain 'timidity in handling metres ap(>arent in parti of the Egyptian section and in much of thd rest or the book. To begin with criticism of the manner -well, to our thinking, there is not enotagh variety of metre; in the first section all but two of the poems are written in tljO sonnet form or in the short 8 : 6 quatrain,/which always seems to us to be suitable only foetbe simplest possible descriptive verse. But for the last verse with ita neediest/ classical commentary—which woald have hien bottler there, if there at all, as a prose footnpte—the 'Egyptian Pastoral1 is a most successful example Oi the sort of picture which be described in this metrical form ; there la no complexity about it, and no action, merely a group by the water side, a glimpse of / still life' in the silence and warmth of a /calm day. But the •Kite above the City/thoogh itoontains one nr two right good lines, seems to us to fail in ! description. We have/a series of pictures of the street life of Cairo but they lack connection. Each verse contains one' feature of Cairene life, perhaps Wo, and the result is not
                        
                        I a picture but a series of cinematoscopio views: the sliort;lined quatrain does not lend itself to enumeration. Homer and AHlton wrote catalogues, but the one used the hexameter and the . other stately decasyllabics.</p>
                    
                    <p>‘Sails on the Nile’ and ‘The Mwerrin’ arc in blank verse and the latter shows v, great deal of power, although tho constany use of the dash gives an impression of jetwinoss at the first reading, which one modifies at tbo second time. 'Sails on the Nile’ develops a pretty thought skilfully and gracefully, but a metrical error, almost-in the middle to?,, inclines tho reader who has an ear towardWwjustice.</p>

                    <p> reads badly, for all the emphasis in the world will never turn a trochee jnto an iambus.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now for the other verse/; the three lyrics for music are well written, and '8leep, sleep, my darling, sleep’ with / 'Roses, roses, red and white’ are really graceful aongs,</p><cb n="3"/>
                    <p>but the verses in the short quatrain all through | the book are not strong, and reveal the fact I that if you choose this metre you must be almost timorously careful in your choice of j subject and your phrasing; otherwise your j, dritios will irreverently quote hymns dr Doctor . j; ‘Jjtts</p>

                    <p>Wo have insisted too strongly perhaps on some of the weak points in Mr. Cookson’s volume.

                    <p>“After much questioning it was decided where the hoys liad been tipping the day of the find, I and l*rofessor Petrie gave orders that Smayne and a boy were to sit at the foot of the rubbish heap, while the rubbish was tipped elsewhere, and examine the soil through a sieve till they (found the head . . Three weeks soon weut by, and it was a miracle that it did not take three months, when you consider the ! tip heap, and the small amount of soil that could be riddled carefully each day. 1 used to 1 bail him often from a distance, and ask if they i.hacT'g^tit; but always the same answer came 1 backy/Lissa, liasa’ (Not yet, not yet), until one day be shouted to me and asked mo to come. 1 went, and he showed mo a tiny jiolisWd thing, which looked like some curious ape figure or old chessman. Then 1 saw he was holding it upside down, and when I turned it, it was really the head of Khufu, beautifully carved and polished. ”</p>
                    
                    <p>The Temenos had yielded up its last treasure, aud the statuette, repaired and whole, now.occupies a place of honor at Cairo. The interesting port of this discovery is that it was made from earth which bad already been examined and "exhausted" of its treasures by a French expedition. That fact should be encouragement enough for all to persevere.</p></div>

                    <p>In an interesting interview in the "Book Monthly," Mr. Johu Lane dates the prevailing distaste for poetry from tho date of—Oscar Wilde’s arrest. "Taking the risk on every book of verse I published, 1 had till then,’’ he says, "made a commercial success of all. Prom then onward it was different, and only with volumes of poetry by writers whose eminence makes it unnecessary to name them, oouid I do more than get baok my outlay ....

                    <p>Bien que lo marché de* valeur* n'ait juta présenté cette semaine la même animation quo la semaine dernière, cependant le nombre des affaires a été fort satisfaisant eu égard à la saison des fêtes que nous traversons. Certaines valeurs, outre autres la Sait &amp; Soda, les Nun- govich Hotels la Daïra et la Banque d’Athènes ont mémo donné lieu il d'importantes transac­tions. Les petits spéculateurs ont beaucoup contribué fi refroidir le marché : ayant pour la plujjçY* réuasi, lors de la récente débâcle, à consàrver leurs titres, ils n’attendaient qu'une Occasion pour s'en débarrasser. Aussi, en re­voyant les anciens prisai sw*^l empressés de réaliser. D'autre part^ rie mateAÇ, de Londres a été plutôt calme en ÿi qui concerne les valeurs égyptiennes, ce qu'i* faut attribuer au manque d'ordres d'achat pro pliant d'Éiÿpte. De plus, les cotons, qui restent ' '* * niveau très bas, commencent à influencer quelque peu les titres fonoiers, bien que d'une manière générale, ainsi que nous l'avons dit précédemmeut, la corbeille des valeurs soit désormais à peu près indépendante de celle des'cotons. Tout cela, réuni aux fêtes du premier do l’an, est peu fait, on en conviendra, pour donner de l’entrain à
                    la corbeille Uue constatation des plus intéres­santes à faire o’est que les opérations &amp; terme, qui, il y a un mois environ, avaient atteint d'énormes proportions, ont presque totalemeut disparu de notre place
                    Le mouvement en a bien souffert quelque peu, mais encore faut-il se féliciter de cet heu roux changement On se rappelle, en effet, que, grâce à co. opérations à terme, on assistait fi la fin de chaque quinzaine et de chaque mois à des liquidations très laborieuses, se terminant le plus souvent en ventes forcées, aussi nuisi­bles â la place qu'aux spéculateurs eux-mêmes-
                    La BSnque Nationale a débuté ferme à Jlj, mais n’a pu, en raison de fortes ventes, se main­tenir àce prix. Elle fléchit le 12 â 24 l 1 G,pour reprendre en clôture à 24 1/8 acheteurs. La demande est excellente. Ou fait circuler dans le public dytferses rumeurs de distribution d’ bon dividende, mais oelui ci ne peut être connu d'une^açon précise et officielle avant la pro­chaine assemblée générale. On a remarque cette semaine que la demande se portait spéciale­ment sur la Nouvelle Emission qui reste tou­jours de 7 8 au dessouâ de l'ancienne.
                    L'Agricole a été très ferme durant toute la semaine entre H* 1 10 et Ut I S. Les transac­tions ont été nombreuse^.

                    De 3 7/8 la Delta Land monte -uhitement il 4 1/16 pour clôturerait prix d’ouverture, 3 D'importantes transactions ont eu lieu. La hausse de cette valeur a été déterminée par une demande de Londres qui a soudainement cessé. Le cours a aussitôt réactionné. ( >n attend des détails sur la prochaine émission pour savoir k quoi s'en tenir.
                    la Daira Banieh a été en grande faveur pendant toute la semaine. Elle débute à 22 1/16, atteint 22 5/16 et clôture il 22 1 8 ache leurs. On a échangé 5 à 6,000 titres.
                    Après avoir ouvert très ferme k. 124 1/2— 125,4a Banque d’Athènes/réactionne vers la fin à 122 1/2, cours auquel elle est excessive­ment ferme. La distribution prochaine d'un bon dividende contribue k retenir le prix.
                    Le cours de la Cassa di Scouto et di Rispar mio monte de 243 &amp; 250 pour clôturer à 248. Cette hausse est le résultat de la prochaine émission qui doit avoir lieu le 6 février prochain.
                    Délaissée au début il 49 1/2, LBehera at­teint graduellement 50 1/2 et 51 acheteurs en clôture. On s'attend d'ici peu il un mouvement ' sur cette valeur. En attendanl les affaires res tent clairsemées.
                    La Wardan Estate monte de 7 1/2 à 7 3/4 acheteurs.
                    Les Tramways d'Alexandrie ont aussi été en faveur durant cette semaine. Ils fluctuent de 143 1/2 k 145 les Privilégiées ot de 370 il 381 les Dividendes et clôturant respectivement li 144 et 370. Les recettes sont do plus en plut florissantes. La semaine finissant le 7 janvier montre une augmentation de 17,548 P.T. sur la semaine correspondante de 1904.
                    Très soutenue également la Ramleli Railway à 8 1/4, avec toutefois peu do transactions. Ici l'augmentation des recettes est plus sensible encore que sur les Tramways ; elles atteignent 81,894 P.T. contre 65,729 P.T. Tannée dernière pour la semaiue finissant le 7 janvier.
                    Les Markets débutent k 23/6, atteignent 24, pour retomber en clôture il 23/9. Les recettes pour les 9 jours finissant le 31 décembre sont de 625 LE. seulement oontre 1,065 L.R. l'an­née dernière. La différence entre les 2 exercices est maintenant de plus de 12,000 LE. à l'avan­tage de l'année passée.

                        La Spinning and Weaving Ço. a donné liea à d'importantes transactions. Plus do 10,000 titres ont été échangés. Le oours est monté de i27/32 à 31/32 pour clôturer à 29/32 en excel-
                        Mills restent calmes à 7/3 ache-
                        Les mnigovicli Hotels aocusent une forte hausse sur la Semaine dernière. A 9 3/8 à l’ou­verture, ils atteignent 10 1/16 et clôturent à 10 acheteurs. On attribue cette amélioration à deux causes principales, d’abord à la saison des touristes qui est très brillante cette année et ensuite à la rumeur de la fusion des Nungo- vich Hotels avec les hôtels Baehler, (Shepheard et Ghezireli Palace).
                        L’Anglo American Nile a suivi la hausse des Nungovich. Elle passe de 4 13/16 à 5 1/16 pour finir demandée il 5. Elle montera encore si nous nous eu rapportons aux bénéfioes crois­sants d’une saison excessivement brillante.
                        Lus actions privilégiées Khédivial Mail ont donné lieu à une petite demande à 3 3/4. Les Ordinary Shares sont à 11, cours purement .nominal.
                        Los Ciments d’Egypte sont demandés à 109.
                        Par suite de réalisations los actions des bras­series fléchissent, celle de la Crown Browery de 220 k 216 et celles de la .Brasserie des Pyra­mides de 133i k 126.

                        La Nile Cold Storage est demandée à lj.
                        La Corporation of Western Egypt a donné lieu il de fortes transactions entre 1 7/16 et TÜ 16. On s’attend à ce que cette valeur qui n’a pas encore été sérieusement lancée sur le marché d'Alexaudrie y soit bien accueillie.
                        La Sait and Soda a été la valeur la plus eu vue cette semai uq. Elle a débuté il 43/6, fléchi .le U à 41,3 et atteint le 12 jour de l'assem­blée.) 43 6 pour retomber en clôture à 42.9 vendeurs.
                        Le cours avait atteint hier dans la matinée 43 1" 1 2 à la suite des nouvelles de LondreB. Malheureusement la plupart dos spéculateurs qui avaient attendu de connaître le résultat de l'assemblée pour se débarrasser de leurs t:ti - ont profite de l occasiou et la valeur a réaction- ne de 43, lu 1 2 il 42 9. On s’attend, aussitôt cette liquidation terminée, à ce que le cours reprenne d'une façon sensible.</p></div>

                <p>If an ^institution is privileged from its birth to arouse the enthusiasm of generous friends, it may be predicted that its future will at least be interesting ; Mid if the institution, as it grows older, earns the additional privilege of provoking the attention of watchful critics. it may be assumed that it is alive and doing »..rk in the world. .In the full belief that Victoria t' i.i.K>;r. is not only alive but growing stronger the' headmaster presents the second annual report to the Committee, the members of which, ho is persuaded,' will ,,gr.v with him in holding that, while the functions' ,,f riticisro and enthusiasm are different enough, the province of eaeh^fs the same, and that since both

In consequence of these improvements and alterations the 13th f October had been'fixed as the earliest day on which the school could, be re-opened. As that date drt-w close, it was thought by many that neither the budding nor the playground would be ready. The upper story did not present a hopeful appearance, the playground had been converted into a somewhat com- plieitted system of light railways, the front door hung d/jeetedly in' mid-air and the only entrance to the eiissrooms was by escalade.

The work continued on the lines already- laid down. A fourth form was constituted, and it should here be stated for tlicrhciiefit of those to whom English nomenclature is unfamiliar that the word “form” or bench corresponds to the expression “year” in use at the primary and secondary- schools of .thqf Egyptian Government. The first form is accordingly the lowest, euid not the .highest in the school.</p></div>

                        <p>To these four forms it is intended to add an- otherj^/ear* by year, as the age of the pupils in- crea$es^un$il ultimately a course shall have been providoirivwlrteh will give efficient instruction to boys between the ages of seven and eighteen years. With four classes it was possible t attempt a somewhat more ambitious programme. The difference in knowledge between boys in the first and fourth form will best be grasped by a reference to the scheme (p. 23) which presents in tabular form a conspectus of the work done throughout the school. From a very humble beginning in the first form, (in which h»w-ver it is claimed thut solid foundations are laid, and in which boys should if possible begin their school life) the work reaches u quite respectable level in the fourth form. The subjects taught included all those of last year with the addition of a course of elementary- practical Geometry successfully -undertaken by Mr. Luiuclj. In addition to the useful monthly examinations, which nave become a feature of the school work, a general examination of the whole school was held in the second Week of Julv,</p></div>

Such an arrnuge- ment, honestly carried out, lias much in its favour, for.jio. one i- I totter aide to sound by appropriate questions the depth- of a boy’- ignorance or knowledge than the master who has been face to face with his difficulties throughout the year Thut this examination

                        by the l-.vs themselves, but by Mr. Gould, who kindly l«nd the school uu official visit and sati-ficiLdiimseli ..the subject »>f examination happened,, that /tiny to be composition, thut the boy- received m> a-istance in their work. Tho headmaster i- aware, however, tha parent- look for some outside testimony, and with the help ..f Mr. Gould he is trying to arrange that the annual examination of the school shall be conducted' by the Oxford und Cambridge .'schools Examination board, the Higher Certificate of which gives exemption from all the important preliminary examinations in England. If this arrangement can be curried out, the pupils of the school will l>e entered for an excellent examination, and in the event of their Is-ing successful, parents will have not only u guarantee that the work of the school is good, but a certificate which will ciiuhle their sons, if they so desire, to continue their studies either at English medical and engineering schools, or 1 .etter still, at the two great English Universities.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>THE RESULTS.</head>
                        <p>Returning to tho examinations of last summer, the results were read out to the boys before the school broke up. Especial mention must be made of the excellent work of G. Valassopoulo, M. Antonius, G. Antonius and E. Harle in the IV. Form, of A. Nimr, F. Stent, R. Tuby in the HI. Form, and of J. Lascaridis in the II. Form. Solid work was also done by some who were not so fortunate as to win prize*; among these may- bo mentioned in the fourth form form S. Checri and U. Prangi ; and in the third form J. Tuby, A. G. I’saltis and E. Cordahi, all of whom</p><cb n="2"/>
                        <p>worked steadily throughout the year. On the whole the results obtained were ver^ encouraging to the masters. In French the boys did particularly well under M. Dumont whose methods and discipline have won the approval of those most competent to judge. In English the progress of almost all the boys was (it is no exaggeration to say) astonishing. Iu Mathematics, History and Geography satisfactory results were obtained, and in Drawing some good work was done for Mr. Mustard who had taken much trouble in teaching this important subject Of the boys</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>PROFICIENCY IN ARABIC.</head>
                        <p>the headmaster is not yet qualified to speak. It is therefore with all the more satisfaction that he is able to report that in the opinion of Sheikh Abdul Aziz Shawiah, who is now assisting the Professors of Arabic at Oxford, the standard reached in Arabic is remarkably good, especially in consideration of the fact that to so many of the boys Arabic is a foreign tongue. The headmaster wishes to take this opportunity of thanking Sheikh Mohammed Hamed, who has succeeded not only in teaching those to whom Arabic is their mother tongue but also in inspiring others, to whom it is an exceedingly difficult aqd at first even a repellent language, with a desire to advance beyond the threshhold. The thanks of the Committee are also due in an especial degree to Sheikh Abdul Aziz Shawish for his kindness in putting the boys of the third anti fourth forms through a searching oral examination.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>PRIVATE READING.</head>
                        <p>As supplementary \to work in school, which is necessarily restricted in its scope, everything |(ossible has been done to encourage the private reading of the ptipil.s. However much a master may help a boy by his teaching, the boy, ifv’properly directed, can. Jo much more for himself. But in order to read profitable books it is necessary to have access to a library. Victoria College is still in .its infancy, and a school library does not yet exist. Something however in the way of creating one has been done by the boys themselves and something has been done by their friends. In last year's report mention was made of lending library, rendered possible in the first instance by grfta from the National Bank and Mr. Alderson. This year the headmaster has the pleasure to record further gifts and donations. The Earl’ of Meath, to whom the school is also indebted for a Howard Vincent Map and a dummy rifle, very kindly presented a copy of 'Milner'* England in Egypt, and among other gifts there were £5 from, an anonymous donor and £10 from Dr. Morrison, who in this and in other ways has proved a very generous friend to the school. The lending library now numbers over 200 volumes and possesses many useful books of reference. It is pleAsant to be able to state that the' latter arc in constant requisition, and it is to be hoped that it may be passible some slay to add to their number.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>GAMES AND DRILL.</head>
                        <p>Out of school the boys had their time well occupied with games and drill—too much time it has been complained by some. But in the opinion of the headmaster, who on this subject errs, if error it bo, in good company, long school hours defeat their own object. Boys, discouraged bj/tho teaching of lessons which seem to have no ejtd, allow their attention to wander in school, while (out of doors they lose their natural aptitude for play and exercise. It has been said of the Japanese soldier, that when ho is not energetically and cheerfully at work, he is energetically and cheerfully at/play. This is an ideal which with some other manly virtues wo may well borrow from that gallant People. The very important work of supervision again fell principally upon Mr. Mustard and Mr. I/owjck, who once more undertook the duties of drill instructors, entering very heartily into a difficult, and sometimes discouraging work. In this they were materially assisted by two of the senior bdys, T. Checri,</p><cb n="4"/>
                        <p>and A. Vorny, who developed into two smart corporals. The two companies, as last year, had the honour of lysing inspected by the Earl of Meath, who with Iauly Meath visited the school in the Spring, It .was encouraging /to the instructors to bo informed that since the last inspection there had been a very marked" improvement. The thanks of the Committee are due to Mr. Mustard and Mr. Lowick not only for acting as drill instructors, but also for undertaking again the supervision of the playground and the omnibus, duties which, entailing no little sacrifice of personal comfort, have contributed very much to the efficiency of the school.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>ATHLETICS.</head>
                        <p>The games, that important department of a boy’s life, have grown into a serious institution. Hockey found its proper place in tho season which intervenes between football and cricket, though these two games, as in England had the larger number of partisans. At football the school XI., not flying at the highest game, escaped defeat, and at cricket a new departure was made. Thanks to the kindness of the Alexandria C. C. represented by its captain Mr. T. H. Marsden, and its Hon. Secretary Mr. F. G. Freeman, the boys were able to play once a fortnight on the excellent ground belonging to the Club—a privilege which they thoroughly appreciated. Mr. Marsden and Mr. Freeman did so much to make the cricket of the school a success that the warmest thanks of all are due to them and also to another enthusiastic member of the Club, Mr. F. W. Carver, who presented the school with £20 to be devoted to games. The money has been spent on two asphalt pitches, which it will be possible to use all the year round. The balanco which remains will also be laid out on improvements in the playground, possibly in the purchase of iron stanchions and a rope to enclose the football ground and mark out a running track.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>80ME INCIDENTS.</head>
                        <p>Although it has not been thought necessary to describe at length the routine of the school year, it would not bo right to pasx oyer without mention the incidents which most strike the imagination of the boys. To the visit of Lord and Lad.v Meath allusion has already been made. The school was also honoured on April 28th by the visit of Lord and Lady Cromer, aocompanied on this occasion by Mr. and Mrs. Gould, and received on behalf > of the Committee by Mr. Alderson, Mr. Kingham and Mr. Preston. The visit was especially interesting to everyone as this was the first occasion on which Lady Cromer had had the opportunity of seeing the school, since the foundation stone was laid. Lord Cromer as usual made a very close inspection of the boys and of the buildings. His criticisms were brief and to the- point. “The boys," he said, “looked happy and the playground bare.” The headmaster has reason to believe that Lord Cromer was pleased witja the intelligence as well as the 'appearance of the boys and ho may perhaps be allowed to repeat that the Committee has good reason to be grateful for the interest which Lord Cromer has constantly shown in the school. Again and again ho has been assured by pareuts that to them there is no Jbetter guarantee of the usefulness of the school than the visits of Lord Cromer and his reference to the school in his annual Reports.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>THE KINDERGARTEN.</head>
                        <p>It must not be supposed that the headmaster in speaking of the success of the school so far is unaware of the weaknesses which exist. But with the means at tho disposal of the Committee everything possible has been done. The Kindergarten recommended last year has been built and the circular announcing its' proposed establishment has had a most encourag­ing response. It is ndt, however, yet certain whether it will be possible to open the Kindergarten at all, and that for two reasons: first, because among the applicants are many little girls (the question immediately arises to what school can they go when they have passed/the Kindergarten age 1), and secondly because Victoria College itself is full. The entries this year number 54 and tho building intended for the Kindergarten provides tho only classroom into which it is possible to overflow. To what has this success been due 1 Partly to the enoouragement and Bupjwrt to which reference has already been made, partly to the admir­able position of the school by the sea, to the well arranged classrooms and spacious playground (which the Committee has so wisely enclosed), and partly to the fact that English education for boys and girls is called for throughout the country with no uncertain voice. For two years the masters have worked hard and cheerfully for the good of the school. The future is not in their hands. In tho brief sketch which follows an attempt has been made to show where in the opiuion of the headmaster this future lies.</p></div>
                    <div type="subsection"><head>THE REFLECTIONS OP MR. LIAS.</head>
                        <p>An Englishman, if he were asked what he thought uost characteristics of tho institution peculiar to his ountry, would perhaps reply that it was their power to stand the test of time; and if he were further esked to give a reason for this vitality his answer might be that English institutions based upon the bed­rock of experience and susceptible of modifications as the nature of the case required, had possibly not yet attained the limits of their natural growth. The truth is that profiting by the lessons of the Norman Conquest, Englishmen, victors and vanquished alike, out off geographically from the rest of the world, learned betimes to estimate at its true value tho homely lesson of give and take. First in the State and afterwards in tho Church compromise has been the keystone of our national polity and it is the readinesa to compromise which is still one of the secrets of our national strength.</p>
