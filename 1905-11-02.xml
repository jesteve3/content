                        <head>THE RESTORATION OF NOUZHA.</head>
                        <p>Nouehs Gardens, situated on the bank of the Mahmoudieh Canal, near
                            Ramleh, destined shortly to become one of the fashionable rendezvous of
                            Alexandrians. For years past the grounds, at one time beautiful, have
                            been allowed to go to wreck and ruin, being only used for an occasional
                            picnic party. A charge has now come over the place, however. The
                            Municipality, at the beginning ol the present year, very wisely decided
                            to take the property in hand, and restore it to its pristine beauty ;
                            and judging by what we saw during a recent visit, a most excellent
                            beginning has been made. If the necessary funds are forthcoming
                            Alexandria will in a very short time be endowed with a park and grounds
                            worthy of a big city, attractive not only to residents—who are sore to
                            make it their favorite drive—but also to visitors. The grounds now
                            present a most charming and fascinating aspect. Avenues, alleys, and
                            paths have been laid out, all the undergrowth has been removed, the
                            grotto and pond have been completely relaid, hedges trimmed, and new
                            beds and a lawn laid out. Great attention has been paid to the trees; of
                            which some very rare specimens are to be found, and these have been
                            brought Well into view. A special plot, shaded and cool, has been
                            cleared out for the use of children, We particularly noticed a plot laid
                            out with chrysanthemums. There are a thousand of these plants to be seen
                            in full bloom, and they present a striking and most beautiful mass of
                            colours, some blooms being particularly noticeable for their vivid
                            colour and size. It is quite, a good show, and Augurs well for the
                            future. We hope that now this excellent beginning has been made the work
                            will be kept up, and that by next year, with a band day and the
                            necessary accommodation provided for afternoon tea, etc., Nousha will
                            become the rendezvous of our local "smart set.”</p>

                        <p>In a letter to the London "Standard,” on speculation in sugar,
                                <persName>Mr. Geo. Mathieson</persName>, managing director of
                            Messrs. <persName>Clarke, Nickolls</persName>, and Coombs, Ltd., says :—
                            The French expert at the Brussels Convention, the late <persName>M.
                                Cronier</persName>, although in the end he overreached himself;
                            quite correctly recognised in that international compact the finest
                            Instrument for speculation that had been forged for many a day. Its
                            restrictions in preventing the free circulation of sugar delivered
                            consumers for a time into the cornerers’ hands. It was largely owing to
                            the small surpluses of Russia, etc., that <persName>Mr.
                                Martineau</persName> despises, finding their way round, and setting
                            free for export sugar otherwise required in non-prohibited countries,
                            that the corner was ultimately broken up. Although M. Cronier, by
                            attempting to grasp to much, came to disaster, other more fortunate
                            speculators succeeded in fleeting sugar consumers in this country alone
                            to the tune of at least £6,000,000 during the last twelve months, as can
                            be seen by the Board of Trade figures. It is no mean achievement, and
                            while the convention is in operation, other speculators, when chance
                            offers, will work it to the same end more effectively, and, perhaps,
                            guided by the Cronier disaster, more wisely for themselves. But we are
                            hopeful our lesson has been learnt, and that no British Government will
                            be mad enough to renew the contention, or ever again enter into a
                            similar compact, In an article on the financial situation and the
                            position of the Basque de Ftaooe, the "Monitear des InWrtts Maferiels”
                            remarks:-- " Il est certain que si les traites Cronier avaient été

                        <p>The Egyptian Government has issued a circular relative to those who wish
                            accompany the Mahmal caravan to the Hadjas, in which it points out the
                            advantages which are gained by making the pilgrimage under such
                            conditions. This year, as in former years, the Government has decided to
                            allow those who are desirous of so doing, and who undertake to submit to
                            the prescribed conditions, to accompany the" Mahmal caravan. Those who
                            take Advantage of this offer of the Government will he placed under the
                            protection of the Emir el Hag and the military escort of the Malmat, and
                            in case of need they will receive immediate medial care and ebemists,
                            who are at the disposal of the accompanying pilgrimage are also attached
                            to the Caravan. The journey will also be accomplished by the shortest
                            possible and least laborious route, and under special conditions as
                            regards comfort safety, and prestige. The cost of the expedition will be
                            lessened by joining the caravan, as pilgrims will profit by the
                            advantageous arrangements which the Emir el Hag is able to make
                            regarding camels. In So far as the expenses of the journey concerned,
                            experience has shown that the sums deposited in former years have been
                            insufficient, and for the present year it has been decided that those
                            accompanying the Mahmal must make the following deposits, according to
                            the degree of comfort they desire to travel in: L.E. 25.500mm. for each
                            first class passenger; including charge for one camel (an extra charge

                            second class passenger with [ ] camel ; L.E. 20.500mm. for the third

                        <head>THE LATE <persName>SIR CHARLES WILSON</persName></head>
                        <p>The "Times" gives the following appreciation of he <placeName>Sudan</placeName> career of the
                            late Sir Charles Wilson:--- When troubles with Egypt were brewing
                            in1882, Sir Charles Wilson volunteered for special service in that
                            country, and after the [Next few lines of text are illegible] <persName>Lord
                            Dufferin’s</persName> mission until the end of 1883. For the Egyptian campaign he
                            received a medal and the Khedive a Star and promotion by brevet to the
                            rank of colonel in the Army. He also received the honorary degree of
                            D.C.L. from Oxford in 1883. Up to that time honors had been gained in
                            peaceful fields either by scientific ____________ or by ___matic
                            successes. As a natural consequence of _______________________ his
                            military advancement had been relatively slow. The chance for him to
                            earn distinction in the leadership of men did not come until he had
                            lost the habit of thinking and acting as a soldier. All Sir Charles
                            Wilson's Oriental experience and familiarity with Ara________ marked him
                            as an _____________ to direct the intelligence branch of a force
                            operating against native tribes in the Sudan. For these duties
                            therefore, he was appointed Deputy-Adjutant and Quartermaster-General on
                            the Headquarters staff with <persName>Lord Wolseley</persName>'s expedition for ____ relief
                            of <persName>General Gordon</persName> in September, 1884. One of his subordinates then was
                            <persName>Captain Horatio Herbert Ki_____</persName>, who, holding temporary rank as a major
                            in the Egyptian Army, had been sent up the Nile by <persName>Sir Evelyn Wood</persName>
                            earlier that year to prepare the way for an advance by enlisting the
                            services of Sheikhs who had no thrown in their lot with the Dervishes.
                            Much of the organisation on which Sir Charles Wilson relied afterwards
                            for news of the Mahdi's movements was thus rady at hand. Nevertheless he
                            had to exercise great discretion and keen judgement in sifting the
                            evidence of agents whose stories were more often than not untrustworthy.
                            That he performed these duties to Lord Wolseley's entire satisfaction is
                            proved by frequent mention in despatches, though events several thinks
                            discounted the value of his conclusions. He did however, succeed in
                            establishing communications with the beleagureed her in
                            _______________________ were kept up to the last by ___________________
                            fidelity to the cause they served _____________ in question simply
                            because _____________ taken did not give them a _____________ any
                            important secrets. When <persName>Sir Herbert Stewart</persName>'s little force set out from
                            <placeName>Korti</placeName> on January 6, 1885, for a hazardous but glorious march across the
                            <placeName>Bayuda</placeName> desert, Sir Charles Wilson accompanied it. To him Lord Wolseley
                            had entrusted a letter for General Gordon, with orders that he should
                            deliver it into the hands of the defender of Khartoum. There was no
                            thought at that time of the possibility of his having to command the
                            desert column if Sir Herbert Stewart should be killed or wounded
                            seriously. Lord Wolseley had made arrangements, which were shattered
                            when in <persName>Colonel Fred Burnaby</persName> fell fighting at <placeName>Abou Klea</placeName>. After Sir
                            Herbert Stewart was wounded fatally in the second battle at <placeName>Gubat</placeName> the
                            command devolved on Sir Charles Wilson in cirute of his seniority. Being
                            thrust suddenly into the position of military leader for which previous
                            training had not qualified him he did his best to cary out Sir Herberts
                            Stewart's plans. Whether he delayed too long after Gordon's steamers had
                            joined him or simply took the common-sense precaution which
                            circumstances demanded, is a question about which differences of opinion
                            will alas exist. There was certainly nothing to justify the bitter
                            attack made upon him because of his failure to reach Khartoum before it
                            fell. A scapegoat was wanted to draw off attention from the blunder of
                            others in higher authority, and he suffered accordingly. The attack
                            delivered by Sir. Charles Wilson at <placeName>Metemmeh</placeName> on January 21 did not
                            though unsuccessful, involve waste of time, because the four steamers
                            from Khartoum only reached him while his troops were being withdrawn
                            from that attempt. The next day, a hostile force having been reported
                            near <placeName>Shendy</placeName>, Sir Charles Wilson thought it necessary to make a
                            reconnaissance down the river in that direction. Then it was discovered
                            that the frail boat needed repairs to their machinery. These were not
                            completed until late January 23. The following morning Sir Charles
                            Wilson,having with him a few British soldiers in red coats and less than
                            200 Sudanese, started Khartoum. When after encountering many
                            difficulties and fighting their way past Derviah batteries, the steamer
                            were not within sight of Khartoum, they were too late. The place had
                            fallen two days earlier, and General Gordon was dead. The belief that
                            this catastrophe might have been averted but for the delay at Metemmeh
                            and in the connoitring towards Shendy rests on no trustworthy evidence.

                            Sudan. "Al Moayad" gave publicity to a scheme for preaching the Koran in

                            allowed to preach the Gospel. Many moelena notables are said to be very

                            are generously supporting the scheme. According to "Al Moayad" a sheikh
