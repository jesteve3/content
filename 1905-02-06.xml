the nobles have decided to present two
addresses to the Tsar. One of them, of a con-
servative nature, and adopted by a majority,
says that peace at present is impossible witheut
humiliation, and expresses confidence in an
ultimate victory. It deprecates, however, any
internal reform till tile war is ended. The

and rejected by the majority, advocates the
collaboration of the Tsar and people on the
question of reform.	(Uniter.)</p>

Speaking at Eastleigh, Mr. Lee, Civil Lord

<p>The Duke of Cannaught inspectod the 2nd

aud lasting long hours</p>
<p>At 8.30 p.m. the Duke and Duchess, with
the Princesses and suite, attended the Agri-
cultaral and Industrial Show at the Zoologi-
cal Gardens, where all sorts of Sudanese
products and examples of native work. were
exhibited. The Royal visitors were greatly
interested in the examples of native handi-
craft, and purchared several trophies, silver
ornaments, etc.</p>
<p>A garden party on the same day was attend-
ed by all the British officers and officials
and was followed by a dinner at the Rifle
Brigade mess.</p>
<p>On the morning of Saturday a most suc-
cessful parade was hold of the British aud
Egyptian troops in garrison at Khartoum,
under the command of Lewa Henry Pasha,
C.B. The troops who paraded consisted of the
2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade under Lieut-CoL
Wilson, the Egyptian Cavalry and Artillery,
and two Intantry Brigades composed as
follows</p>
<p>1st Brigade: 2nd, 3rd, and 7th Battalions.
2nd „ 4th, 5th, and 16th Sudanese.
H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught telegraphed
to H.H. the Khedive his satisfaction at the
performance of the troops, and expressed to the
Governor-General his high approval of the
bearing, steadiness, and efficiency which they
had displayed.</p>
<p>According to the Meteorological Observatory
at Helonan, a sun-spot was visible in Cairo on
Friday last with the naked eye. This spot is
said to be one of the largest ever open, and it is
supposed to be the resultant of the group of
small spots which were visible in the early
part of last month. The appearance of
this great spot seems to give a good opportu-
nity for investigating the very interesting pro-
blem of the connection between sun-spots and
magnetic storms on the earth, and it would be
interesting and helpful if practical telegraphists
would put upon record any interruption caused
in their work on Friday, when the spot reach-
ed the centre of the disc.</p>

<head>NOTICE TO OUR READERS.</head>
<p>The “Egyptian Gazette" arrives in Cairo every
night at 7.30 p.m and the house to house
delivery of the paper to our subscribers begins
at 9 p.m. All complaints as to delay in receiv-
ing the "Gazette'' should be addressed to the
Local Director of the Cairo Post Office. A
number of complaints would be obviated if
letter-boxes were put up at the main entrances
of subscribers' houses.</p>
<p>Excellent arrangements, brilliant decoration,
carriages, dogcarts, and what-not, beflowered
and begarlauded, deserved something better
than the weather that chilled Cairo yesterday.
the morning was overcast till about 10 a.m.,
then it cleared only for a cold and dust-laden
wind to bring the clouds up again, and-shortly
before 3 p.m. rain began to H. Thencefor-
ward showers came down intermittently till
close on 6 o'clock, and theugh it cleared later
the air was always raw and chilly.
The crowd of spectators was, none the less,
large and good-tempered. There was nothing
approaching an accident to chronicle, for the
police worked indefinitely with the committee
to keep the carriages in line and the public
from under the wheels. And here we may state
that Major Vernon Jarvis and Capt Tecci
deserve great praise for the excellent handling
of the proceesion. The Ghezireh Casino, the
hotel avenue, and the paths road the lake
were gaily deoorated, at least three bands were
playing, two as a rule together, the Inniskil-
lings in the band-stand and the Blue Hunga-
rians in the casino, in front of which was the
semi-circular space reserved for the members
of the committee of fetes, flanked by stands
which were full of spectators by 3 p.m. Other
stands from which and on which a heavy
fusillade of flowers and confetti was kept up,
had been erected opposite the casino, and tea,
which was apparently much appreciated, was
served in the control hall of the casino itself.
It would be impossible to give a full and ac-
curate description of the deoorations of the
motors, dog carts, carriages, and all kinds of
vehicle that circled round the casino between
8.20 and 6 p.m. Most of them were abund-
antly, some brilliantly,and a good few tastefully
deoorated.</p>
<p>“Hors Coneours” was Omar Bey Sultan's
tonneau, shaped like a swan, beautifully (loco
rated with white roses and lilac. then there
was a hansom, belonging to Mr. Dallioo,
wreathed in green and violet, a victoria deco-
rated with orange and purple, and another
with powdered coachmen and heaped with
white flowers, crowned by an urn full of white
roses, and decorated with pale lemon yellow
ribbons, belonging to M. Sursock, Khayat
Bay's motor with fan-shaped golden-green
screen and parasol-shaped cover hung with
Chinese lanterns, a victoria begarlanded with
pink and white roses; in which a very majestic
Indy held up a white dove perched on or at
tached to her wrist, a dogcart with a purple
and orange hood fastened above it, M. Micbo
let’s camels in gorgeous trappings, palanquin
and a fair freight, one of which bore a mushara
bieb, and M. Cattani’s brake, a mass of
cream and rose. Such were some of the prize
winning.carriagee in the procession
Naturally enough, Cairo society, Euro
pean and native, was largely represent
ed,and had the weather been better the
gardens of the Ghezireh Palace would have
been even more crowded, aud also the terrace,
where multitudes of visitors had tea. The
committee deserve every congratulation ot
the success of the fate despite inclement weather
and for their excellent and well-concieved
arrangements.</p>

<head>THE FITZNER QUARTETTE. W</head>
<p>The Fitxner Quartette gave their first concert
 at Cairo on the 3rd inst at the Continental
HoteL Tbe programme was excellent and the
performance very good. Chamber music is so
infrequent in Cairo that adequate performances
thereof are a real godsend. the programme 
consisted of Mozart's quartette (B flat major), a 
largo by Smetana, a sherzo(Brandts Buys), and
Beetheven’s quartette (Eminorop. 99 no. 2),"—a 
most interesting selection.The Mozart is peculiar-
ly, delightful for its minuet and adagio, which
last was admirably rendered. There were
moments when the performers were perhaps
the least bit too energetic, too apt to “handle" 
the music ; but they certainly gave all the 
finish which this quartette requires. The
Brandts Buys sohorzo was delightfuL both for
itself end for the rendering, and a most charm-
ing (one would almost say amusing) melody,
daintily given. The Smetans, on the other 
hand, was a carious, interesting piece, unusoal 
for the individual treatment of the instra-
ments and for the development of the 
phrases : it formed a strange contrast to the 1
preceding and succeeding pieces. The Beethoven
was one of these quartettes to be grateful 
for a great quarrett. The molto agadio is
a splendid movement, and the allegretto also. 
Here perhaps we might bint that there
was a suspioion of “roughness” in the treat-
ment; the leader seemed shrill at times, almost 
too sudden in attack. Let us say at once that
Herr Walther is a most pleasing cellist he
plays really artistically, and gives a great
perfection of tone. As a last “encore" and
favor, Boccherini's minuet in 'Sordini' was
given; and here perhaps the four executants
showed at their very best, presenting with the 
atmost grace and delicasy its delightful,"
haunting rhythm. We cannot refrain from 
expressing a wish that programmes should be
of some “non-crumpling" material; for instance,
cardboard! In a quartette the least sound or
rustle is more than noticoable: and, appre-
ciative as the audience was, there were 
moments, especially at the very beginning of
movements, when there was a perceptible look 
of that absolute silence so necessary to bring 
out and enhance the attraction of chamber
music. We certainly recommend all lovers of
music to attend the other performances of
this quartette: we feel confident that they
will be amply rewarded in the enjoyment
provided thereby.</p>
