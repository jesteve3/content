THE VIST OF THE FRENCH FLEET.
The official program of the festivities in connection with the visit of the French fleet leaves nothing to be desired. His Majesty the King will review the French Fleet, Admiral Caillard and his gallant and distinguished staff will be his guests, and are specially invited to witness the races for the King’s Cup. Windsor Castle is to be thrown open to our friendly rivals, and we may be sure that our Ruler has still some pleasant surprises in store for his guests. The City of London follows the example of the King ; Portsmouth may be trusted to live up to its reputation, and last but not least, the two Houses will entertain the French officers in Westminster Hall. Six years agp who could have proposed that the centenary year of the Trafalgar would be marked by the fraternisation of the French and British Fleets at Portsmouth following on the friendly visit of a Spanish King to London  Yet nothing could be more necessary in the the interests of the peaces of the world, than the “entente cordiale” between two nations whose ideals as to progress and liberty are identical, whose mutual commercial interests increase daily and whose ancient quarrels have become a source of mutual respect. Our soldiers and sailors have not always had the best of the give and take.  If the British Fleets swept the seas under Nelson and Collingwood, they were well nigh swept from the seas during the later years of the American war, when Guioben and Suffren commanded victorious squadrons of which any Admiral might
have been proud, and though we triumphed under the leadership of the great Iron Duke and the greater Marlborough, the names of Froute noy, Lauffeld, Steinkirk, and neerwinden attest that even the soldiers who swore- and fought- so terribly in Flanders often met their match. Let us,rather, while remembering our victories, forget against whom they were gained and while profiting by out defeats cease to underline in our minds the name of the conqueror. Thus Crecy and Bovines, Hastings and Waterloo, may became names of peaceful omen. We remember a passage in an English novel- alas! the author;s name has escaped us- that bears on this point. Two Englishmen meet in the one guest-room of a tiny hotel in Ireland. Both eye one another over their pipes and one suddenly exclaimed, “Excuse me, but-er-didn’t we meet last behind the fives courts at X…” “Yes,” replies the other, laughing, “and call-over stopped it after the fifth round ;” and the two discuss their old school-days and school quarrels with the greatest good humor in the world. May such be the relations of France and England in the future. They have led a wild and rather quarrelsome youth, they have fought one another out of sheer pugnacity, or out of mutual jealously born of the other’s attentions to various colored enchantresses in Asia and Africa and the Spanish Main, but they are settling down now to a law-abiding and steady middle age. John is ready to admit that Jacques is a right good fellow in spite of his theatrical manner, and Jacques in convinced that John’s reserve hides a warm and friendly heart and both are inclined to think more fondly of Edward the Peacemaker and President Loubet that of William the Conqueror and the Edward who took Calais. Their old war-songs cease to call up memories of battle and Marot;s refrain. “Car France est cimitiere aux Anglsis” and Drayton’s ballad of Agincourt appeal to day to mixed audiences. 


THE MARSHALL ISLANDS
Australian sensitiveness in connection with German aggressiveness in the Marshall Islands is not likely to be blunted by any tranquilising assurance from minor officials. To give strength and validity to such undertakings,, it is essential that they should come direct from Prince von Bulow. Australians will want to know, therefore, whether the German Consul at Sydney had the Chancellor;s authority for stating that the new laws for the government of the insular group will be framed “in accordance with Australians wishes.” Until about 20 years ago, England and Germany had practically the same footing in the islands. But Downing street, fearing that this dual control might breed future complications, as between England and France in the New Hebrides, gravely affronted Australian sentiment by consenting to the establishment of a German Protectorate. It was strictly covenanted, however, that the than “open door,” should remain open. But Teutonio smartness hit on an expedient to close it. The administrative control, including all fiscal arrangements was handed over to a private commercial concern,  the Jaluit Company, which at once proceeded to build up a trading monopoly for its own exclusive profit. One method was the imposition of a duty of L3 per ton on exports in Australian vessels ; but to give this arbitrary act a show of fairness, the same burden was placed on German ship engaged in the business, and so whatsoever sum t disbursed for export duty came back to its treasury as revenue. Australians will wait to see whether Prince von Bulow is of the same mind as this Consular spokesman of his at Sydney.
