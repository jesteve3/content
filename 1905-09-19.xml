<div type="item"><head>AUGUST CUSTOMS RETURNS.</head>

<head>INCREASED EXPORTS.</head>

<p>As was the case last month the Customs report is again out early, and those who predicted that the administration would be unable to “keep it up” will be pleasantly disappointed. The imports for the past month totalled L.E. 1,803,691 against LE. 1,626,093 in August 1904, showing a decided increase. The imports for the period commencing on January 1 and ending on August 31, amounted to L.E. 12,740,913 against LE. 11,831,292 in the corresponding period of the past year, an increase of L.E. 909,621 in favor of 1905.
</p>
<p>The exports, which had showed an advance for the month of July over the figures of July 1904, maintained and increased their lead over August's figures in 1904. In that month the total exports amounted to LE. 800,024. In August 1905, goods amounting to LB. 1,165,510 left the country, a balance of L.E. 365,486. The export figures for the first eight months of the year still show a certain falling off, the total value of goods exported being LE. 11,949,871 against LE. 12,687,678 in the corresponding period in 1904 but another two or three returns like those of August and July, and Egypt’s exports will show an increase on the whole year.
</p>
<p>In August, imports from Great Britain and the British Mediterranean possessions amounted  to LE. 602,049, against HE. 511,691 in August 1904, while for the two-thirds of the year they amounted to L.E. 4,362,501 against L.E. 4,037,635 daring the corresponding period of the past year. French, Russian and Turkish imports show a similar increase for the eight months, but Russian imports fell off last month totalling only L.R. 43,541 against L.E. 64,795 in August last year. In the export tables for the month Great Britain shows an increase of over 80%. France, Germany, and the U.S.A. have also been good customers.
</p>
<p>In the period comprised between New Year’s day 1905 and August 31, the only notable increase of Egyptian exports to any one country is to be found in the oase of Turkey and the U. S. A. Great Britain (L E. 5,806,705 against LE 6,214,459 in 1904) Russia L E. 673.615 against L.E. 948,558, and above all Italy with only L.E. 326,375 against L.E. 705,308 are all notable examples of the decrease in value daring this period of Egyptian exports.

<div type="item"><head>REMARKABLE SWIMMING FEAT.</head>

<p>Mr. George W. Poss, an American by birth, resident in Cairo, and chief engineer of the Egyptian Cotton Mills in Cairo, having heard many people say that to cross the Nile near the bridges was very dangerous and almost impossible, thought he would try the experiment himself, and succeeded with comparative ease. A day so after, he swam from the new bridge at Old Cairo to Basus, which is a small town eleven and a quarter miles distant from Cairo. This feat was accomplished b two hours.
</p>
<p>Accompanying him to prevent any mishap, and to carry Mr. Poss’s clothes, was an employe of the cotton mills named Joseph de Santis.
</p>
<p>At Old Cairo they had some difficulty in getting a boat, the Arabs refusing when they learned of his intention of swimming down the river; bat crossing the river by the ferry they managed to obtain a boat. Reading the centre of the river Mr. Poss undressed, and greatly to the astonishment of the Arabs plunged into the water.
</p>
<p>A strong wind was blowing at the time up the river, and the boat was unable to keep pace with the swimmer ; yet they managed to keep Mr. Poss in view when he passed under the new bridge at Old Cairo, and as far as the bridge at Kasr-el-Nil, after which they lost sight of him entirely. At this point J. De Santis left the boat and taking Mr. Poss’s clothes went on to Rod el Farag thinking he would find him there, and it was not without some misgivings that he failed to do so, for no one had seen a man swim past that place.
</p>
<p>At this point J. De Santis gave up the search and Mr. Poss was left to do his best in a bathing suit. At Basus Mr. Poss went ashore, being afraid of taking cramp with no boat near to render help ; and Amin Effendi, Omdeh of Basus, kindly lent him some clothes and sent some of his men with a boat to take him back to Cairo. If the conditions are favorable, so that a boat can keep pace with him, Mr. Poss hopes very soon to attempt to swim from Cairo to the Barrage.

<div type="item"><head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
<head>CONCORDAT PREVENTIF GRANTED</head>
<head type="sub">(By telephone).</head>

<p>This morning the Commercial Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Court of First Instance decided to grant the Sucreries Company benefit of the Concordat Preventif. The chief feature of the audience was the extremely dear and able speech on behalf of the application of this measure which was delivered by Maitre Carton de Wiart and lasted half an hour. At the conclusion of the speech Judge Tuck, who presided over the audience, Asked if there was any opposition. None was made and the Court adjourned at 11 a.m. to deliberate on this and several other cases. At 12.45 p.m. Judge Tuck announced that the Concordat Preventif had been granted and ordered the company to send their books into court within eight days. No mention was made whether the names of the three liquidators submitted to the court, viz. Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Dubourg, had been accepted or not. Fall particulars will be given to-morrow.
</p>
<p>The decision of the court is fortunate from every point of view. It is the only possible means of preventing a terrible crash which would not only cause heavy losses to many of the company's creditors and to the shareholders, but would ruin the native cultivators of cane. This provisional judgment will not prevent the Parquet from having the compulsionary winding up declared later so as to take criminal proceedings against any director or official found at fault, should events demand this course.
</p>
<p>We publish on page 4 the balance sheet of the Sucreries Company as filed before the Mixed Tribunals on Saturday. We understand that certain errors were to he found in the balance sheet as published by one of on Cairo contemporaries, which, while not invalidating the general result, might cause a certain confusion in the mind of the reader.

<div type="item"><head>THE CHOLERA SCARE.</head>

<p>The recent outbreak of cholera in Russia and Germany has caused quite a scare throughout Europe, and it behoves the Sanitary Department to take prompt measures to prevent the dread malady appearing in Egypt with the return of the pilgrims from the Holy Places of Islam next season. Thera is no denying the fact that the chief homes of cholera are firstly British India, where the disease is endemic, and secondly the Hedjaz, where, however, it assumes an epidemic form. Of recent years Egypt has been visited by cholera on three different occasions. The first visitation was in 1883, when, according to the official returns, it claimed over 28,000 victims. The second outbreak was in 1895, when there were 18,133 deaths from the disease, and the third was three years ago, when the number of deaths recorded was close on 84,000. These figures are those famished by the Sanitary Department, but doubtless they are rather under than over the mortality in each case. It is worthy of note that the disease in this country has invariably broken oat in the hot month, and disappeared with the advent of cold weather, so that it is reasonable to assume that we shall be spared any visitation this year. The matter came last week before the Quarantine Board of Alexandria, which decided that no measures were at present necessary against arrivals from the northern ports of Europe.
</p>
<p>This last invasion of Western Europe seems to have come from India, sweeping slowly and, almost unobserved, over East Europe, then through Galicia, Poland and East Prussia until it reached Dantzio, and lastly Hamburg Any introduction into Egypt through Europe seems somewhat remote, and there is no record that at any of the previous visitations it came from that quarter. On the contrary, each time it appeared in this country it was conclusively proved that it reached ns from the Red Sea ports, and it is in that direction that the sanitary authorities should turn their attention. The Quarantine Board should see that the utmost vigilance is exercised at Tor and Suez on the return of Egyptian pilgrims after the next cold weather, and it is to this board that the country looks for protection against another invasion of cholera. In our opinion there does not seem at present the slightest came for any alarm.
</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>THE PRISONS DEPARTMENT.</head>
<p>The Tanzim service, having decided to macadamise the roads over which are to be laid the new lines and extensions of the Cairo Tramway Company, has requested the Prisons Department to doable its usual supply of macadam. Consequent on this demand the number of prisoners ocoupied in this work at the prison of Abou Zaabel has been considerably increased.
</p>
<p>Two years ago the Ministry of the Interior promulgated an arrete conferring on the Prisons service the right of pardoning such prisoners as had served three quarters of their term and whose conduct had been exemplary daring their detention, exception being, however, made in the case of those who had been found guilty of poisoning animals and burning crops. The Prisons Department having recently asked the above Ministry whether the act of pardon was to be also extended to those of the prisoners who are detained on charges of incendiarism of houses and shounas, has received a reply in the negative.
