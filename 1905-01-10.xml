                    <div type="item"><head>THB SUEZ CANAL.</head>
                        <p>The recent agitation by shipowners in regard to the Sue* Canal has resulted in a reduc­tion of rates from 8j to 8 Irenes per ton, and we frankly congratulate all parties ou the solution arrived at. We do not propose to discuss the question of tonnage measure­ment, and how the iugeuuity of shipbuilders was taxed to oontrive accommodation evading the company’s rule of measurement. As an extreme instance we mention the P. &amp; O- mail steamers “Isis” and •‘Osiris,” which, for »"»1 dues, under the company’s rule, measure some 130 tons only, although these shins are ten times that sire, qua ships.</p>
                            <p>Let us review in a spirit ot equity the I position of primarily, those interested in the Canal. First and foremost stands out that I grand historical character, unsullied and I untarnished by a Panama connection with I unscrupulous and designing speculators and I financiers, the late M. Ferdiuand de Leaseps. I Sympathy,admiration, and respect must ever be I the reward tor his pauenoe, bravery, and skill in I carrying to a triumphant suooess a struggle for I years agaiust diplomatic, engineering, and I difficulties which would have over-1 whelmed a man ot less noble mind. For the opposition ot the British Ministry of that day we may well cry “Peccavi.'* He and his supporters have well merited a nch reward. Then we have Egypt, and one has to recall what the Canal oust this oountry, first in corves | labour, aud, after that was withdrawn, in the heavy sum awarded by the Emperor Napoleon as arbiter to decide the damages payable lor withdrawal of corv6e habour, tor recession ot Wadi Tunuihat land, and tor the lsmailia fresh-water canal. The indemnity amounted to over three million pouuds.</p>
                            <p>The chief partner in the Canal now is un­doubtedly the British Treasury. The purchase in 1875 of the shares of the Khedive Ismail was one oi the most suooesafal and brilliant financial coup* of modern times. For £4,000,0001 there were purchased 176,609 shares, worth today over £40,000,000 and yielding an annual revenue of about £1,000,000. In view of such an enormous profit on this transaction, which gave England 3/5ths of the rwi, a weak Miuistry might give way to clamorous shipping interests and unduly re­duce transit rates. We protest against any sacrifice of the interests of shareholders, or of Srypt The Canal concession is for 99 years from date of the opening on 15th November,] 1869- There are 64 years still to run, wheu, in default of auy new agreement between the EffTOtian Government aud the company, toe . Snosssion shall absolutely oease. Under the concession Egypt was to secure 16 % of the net profits, if renewed for another 99 years 20%, and for any subeeqent renewals 6 % increase each time. The Canal dues are about- £10,000 daily, and mom than half of this is pro</p><cb n="5"/>
                                <p>fit Egypt has a very heavy stake indeed in the Canal. The capital of the Suer Canal Company is £8,000,000, but the market value of the shares today is £79,000,000. This latter sum rapse-^ seats the value of the property, ih which Egypt has a reversionary interest, it is true, actuarial calculation would not show a large “present value" of this enormous prospective sum, but it is ofomdoubted value as collateral security should'such a proposal be mooted as Uie con­version of Unified and Privileged Debts into a loan repayable sixty yean hence.</p>
                                <p>There is a good old maxim, “First catch your hare," and when proposing a new Canal through the Isthmus, we would remind the would-be promoters that, apart from any question of monopoly, which subjeot to just conditions Mr. Leoseps deserved, u he did not actually possess, they have to deal with Egyp­tian territory, and the advisers of his fligh­tless the Khediva^can be sately trusted to Sale- guard the interests'ot aU parties with tud ap­preciation of the principle ot meum and tuum.</p></div>

                        <p>An interesting example ot this was brought ’ I to our notice the other day. One of our ' I provincial correspondents had dared to cri- ’ I uoise the working of a department which 1 is almost as ultimately oouneuted with tho
                            puuliu needs as is the Postal Administration. His criticisms were well-founded, for wo never received any intimation to insert an official dementi, aud we, in foot, are aware that our I correspondent's statements were correct. The I department in quesuon, whioh is under the I control ot an Englishman, would, it might be I presumed, he eager to welcome any criticism,

It could I not refute the criticisms, so it determined to I bring pressure to bear, as soon as it could I discover our correspondent's identity.

                            <p>A Fire broke out early yesterday afternoon in a shop in
                                Toussoun-street, Alexandria. The shop contains a store of
                                chandeliers, lamps, etc., and there was also a considerable quantity
                                of petroleum. It is the property of Count Jacques de Zogheb and was
                                insured for £3,000. The cause is said to be due to a petroleum
                                engine. There was a fire at the same shop three years ago, when it
                                was completely gutted. The shopkeeper is a local subject, of the
                                name of William Guttman. The alarm was given at 1.50 p m. and the
                                engine was on the spot at 1.55 p.m. Owing to the petroleum the blaze
                                and smoke were very great and it was two hours before the Brigade
                                completely mastered it, although eight hoses were kept continually

                            certain changes which it is proposed to introduce into the Codes now

                            the plenary Commission, which is composed of the diplomatic
                            representatives of the Powers, met yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer announced that he, was about to invite the Egyptian
                            Government to issue a circular to the Powers requesting them to agree to
                            a proposal that English should be admitted as one of the judicial
                            languages recognised by the Mixed Courts, on the same footing as French,
                            Italian, and Arabic, which are at present the only recognised judicial
                            languages. Lord Cromer recommended the proposal to the favorable
                            consideration of his colleagues.</p>
                        <p>M. de la Bouliniére, the French Consul-General, stated that, when the
                            circular was received, the question would be considered in a very
                            friendly spirit by the French Governmentp</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer expressed his thanks for the manner id which his proposal had
                            been received by his French colleague.</p>
                        <p>It is almost needless to dwell on the importance and necessity of the
                            step Lord Cro-mer is about to take. When we consider the enormous
                            preponderance of the part which the United Kingdom and her colonies play
                            in the commerce of this country, the exclusion from the Mixed Courts of
                            our language becomes an obvious anomaly. As long back as 1897 the
                            committee of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt made strong
                            representations to Lord Cromer, praying him to urge H..M..’s Government
                            to call for the admission of English as one of the recognised languages
                            to be employed in the Mixed Courts from the period of the renewal of
                            their powers for another term of years in February, 1899. Lord Cromer
                            forwarded the letter of the committee to Lord Salisbury. But the time
                            was not yet ripe. The change is one which must be treated
                            diplomatically, as it can only be made with the acquiescence of the
                            fourteen Powers interested in the formation of the Tribunals, and the
                            political status of Egypt did not admit of such a change being then
                            entertained. This state of things has been changed, and the reform can
                            now be undertaken without letting loose a whirlwind of petty-
                            international jealousies.</p>

                        <p>The Grand Hotel, Helouan, is quite full already and there are many
                            arrivals daily. A number of rooms bare already been booked by visitors
                            now up the Nile. It has been arranged that the famous Bracale Orchestra
                            will play several times at the Grand Hotel, in the afternoon on the
                            terrace and during dinner, as well as for small dances. A beautiful
                            open-air tent saloon has been lately erected on the terrace of the Grand
                            and is the admiration of all visitors.</p>
                        <p>The Bath Establishment has lately been more frequented than usual, and
                            the famous Helouan Baths are recommended specially to people suffering
                            from gout and rheumatism. The strong sulphur water and the massages
                            given by the experienced masseurs and masseusses do ever so much good to
                            all sufferers, and visitors to Egypt should not fail to pay a visit to
                            the Bath Establishment at Helouan.</p>

                        <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                        <head type="sub">SIBERIA.</head>
                        <p>Giordano’s opera Siberia was produced the first time in Egypt at the
                            above theatre on Saturday evening and was not received with any very
                            great demonstration of enthusiasm by the large audience present. This is
                            scarcely to be wondered at when the peculiarly depressing nature of the
                            drama is taken into consideration. Two acts of Siberian penal
                            settlements and chains are scarcely calculated to make the ordinary
                            theatre-goer feel particularly lively or demonstrative. Certain passages
                            in the music remind one of Germania and the effects arrived at are
                            occasionally somewhat similar. The opera, however, requires a second
                            bearing to fully appreciate the ideas intended to be conveyed by the
                            composer. That the work is a very meritorious one is without question.
                            The orchestra on many occasions absolutely drowned the voices of the
                            artistes, who did their best, if the expression may be so used, to make
                            themselves heard above the crash and din of drums, brass, and cymbals.
                            Signorina Amelia Pinto was in splendid voice and gave an admirable
                            interpretation of the exceedingly trying role of Stephana, being
                            rewarded with several handsome bouquets. Signor Giraud gave a fairly
                            good rendering of the part of Vassili, but bis voice is not sufficiently
                            robust to stand him in good stead in an opera like Siberia. As Gleby,
                            Signor Nani made a good impression, and gave, as he always does, an
                            excellent interpretation of the character. Sig. Tisci Ru-bini and the
                            other artistes were equally good in their respective roles. The choruses
                            were particularly well rendered, and both male and female members of the
                            chorus entered fully into their supposed miserable lot in life. The
                            staging was excellent, and the costuming perfect in every way.</p>

                        <p>Marseilles, January 9.</p>
                        <p>Louise Michel is dead. (Havas.)</p>
                        <p>The remarkable woman who has just passed away, and wbo was often so
                            prominent as a French revolutionary leader, was born at Vron- coart in
                            1830, and first distinguished herself by her poetical and musical
                            talents, which were recognised and encouraged by Victor Hugo. In 1860
                            she opened a school in the Quartier Montmartre, Paris; and in 1870 took
                            an active part with the revolutionary Commune, and was made prisoner;
                            and though she eloquently defended herself before the judges, she was
                            sentenced to transportation for life. On the amnesty to political
                            prisoners in 1880 she returned to Paris; and, continuing to take part in
                            Communist assemblies, she was re-imprisoned in 1883, and again in 1886.
                            As an Anarchist, she frequently addressed Hyde Park meetings, and as an
                            authoress she was well-known, having written many revolutionary
                            publications and a novel entitled “The Microbes of Society.".</p>

                        d'Arixandrle- et la Bourse Khédiviale</head>
                    <p>(Audience d'hier de la Chambre Commerciale )</p>
                    <p>Rappelons brièvement l'origine du procès intenté par M.M. Bustros frères à la
                        Société de la Bourse Khédiviale et à l’Association des Courtiers : M.M.
                        Albert et Edouard Bustros, s’étant présentés pour faire partie de
                        l’Associa­tion dos Courtiers d'Alexandrie, s’étaient vus refuser leur
                        candidature par un ballottage. Cette Association, en effet, composée de 74
                        membres, admet le vote comme dans un club ; et c’est là le premier grief de
                        M.M. Bustros. Us protestent contre cétte adoption des mœurs d’un club pour
                        un marché public; ils se plaignent qu'un candi­dat ayant peu de fortune soit
                        reçu plus volon­tiers qu’un autre plus riche qui pourrait créer &amp;
                        l’Association une concurrence redoutable ; ils protestent contre l’atteinte
                        partie par cet exclusivisme à la liberté des transactions com­merciales,
                        exclusivisme qui est contraire à l’es: prit et à la lettre de la loi
                        mixte.</p>
                    <p>Nous donnons ci-dessous, aussi impartiale; ment que possible, un résumé des
                        plaidoiries de divers avocats devant la Chambre Commerciale h l'audience
                        d’hier.</p>
                    <p>Mes Le Moine et Carton do Wiart ont dé­fendu les intérêts de MM. Bustros ;
                        ils ont exposé que l’association des courtiers, tello qu'elle fonctionne à
                        Alexandrie constitue un véritable accaparement du marché à terme égyptien,
                        que cette association est dépourvue de toute existence légale et juridique,
                        qu'elle n'est aucunement autorisée ni par la loi ni pàr un décret et
                        qu'ainsi c'est arbitrairement quelle impose en fait non seulement à ses
                        associés mais également aux tierces personnes les ar­bitraires prescriptions
                        d'un règlement qu'elle a élaboré dans un intérêt purement égoïste et fiscal.
                        La meilleure preuve en est qu’alors qu’il est constant que l'iutérêt public
                        serait assuré par l’admission dans ce groupement de courtiers de maisons
                        aussi riches que respecta­bles, telles que celle de MM. Bustros, la dite
                        association ne manque pas de blackbouler pa­reille candidature parce que les
                        nouveaux venus pourraient enlever à ses anciens mem­bre le bénéfice de
                        courtages importants. Au surplus, cette association ne mérite guère la
                        sympathie de la justice, puisque ses membres ne sont liés par aucun lieu de
                        solidarité au profit de la clientèle et du public. Donc, telle qu elle
                        fonctionne par un prétendu règlement» repoussé tant par la loi que par la
                        (jour d’Ap­pel Mixte, l’association porte atteinte au prin- cice de la
                        liberté commerciale et porte préju­dice à M.M. Bustros frères. Me Le Moine
                        invo­que hautement la grande autorité qui s'attache au très remarquable
                        ouvrage de M. le Conseiller Vercamer ; il en cite des extraits des plus il
                        téressants. Vainement les avocats de l’association soutiennent que celle-ci
                        est et reste chez elle et que conséquemment elle a le droit de refuser tout
                        candidat qui $e présente.</p>
                    <p>Me Lemoine leur répond que les droits indi­viduels se limitent mutuellement,
                        et qu’un acte, même licite en soi, acquiert un caractère délic­tueux dès
                        qu'il porte atteinte au droit d'autrui. Il est, en effet, démontré en la
                        cause que le système d'accaparement, dont l'association s'est rendue
                        coupable, empêche MM. Bustros d’exer­cer librement et normalement la
                        profession de courtiers. Me Le Moine explique, eu effet, qu’il esp
                        impossible à un courtier non associé de faire des affairas à la Bourse
                        Khédiviale. Un exemple d'actualité démoDtre, dit-il, à quel point le
                        despotisme de l'association est intolé­rable : la Banque Impériale Ottomane
                        avait été chargée hier lundi par M. le président du Tribunal d’Alexandrie de
                        vendra 60 actions de la Banque Nationale ; M. le Directeur du dit
                        établissement, ne faisant pas partie de l’as­sociation des courtiers, n’a pu
                        réaliser lui-même le mandat, de justice dont il avait été investi; il a du
                        rester hors de la corbeille et charger un courtier do l’association de faire
                        l’opération dont s’agit Me Le Moine conclut que rien ne saurait mieux
                        démontrer le caractère illégal et arbitraire du prétendu règlement de
                        l’associa­tion des courtiers. MM. Bustros, dont la haute respectabilité
                        n'est contestée par personne, viennent demander protection à la justice et
                        l’application à l’encontre de l’association de l’article 72 du code de
                        commerce.</p>
                    <p>Me Palagi, au nom de la Bourse Khédiviale, mise en cause par MM. Bustros
                        frères, soutient qu’en ce qui concerne sa cliente, la demande est
                        irrecevable, parce que le contrat constitutif de la Bourse Khédiviale,
                        concédé par le Gou­vernement Egyptien, demeure étranger aux demandeurs qui
                        n’y étaient pas partie. Au fond, dit-il, la Bourse Khédiviale a exploité les
                        avantages qui lui ont été concédés par le Gou­vernement en 1683 dans des
                        conditions non critiquables.</p>
                    <p>Me X. Socoli, au nom de l’Association, soutient que la demande de MM.
                        Bustros, est dénuée de tout fondement, que l’Association a parfaitement le
                        droit de se réglementer comme elle l’entend, qu'elle se considère comme
                        étant dégagée de toute oUbligation d’accepter de nouveaux courtiers et qu’en
                        somme son organisation, quoiqu’on ait dit Me Le Moine, îi’empècbe pas les
                        courtiers Kfceé d’exercer leur profession. Il ajoute que la demande apparaît
                        encore comme irrecevable a un àutre point de vue, &amp; savoir quelle aurait
                        pour, objet d’inviter le tribunal K légiférer en Pétât de silence delà loi
                        aur la matière.</p>
                    <p>Me Carton de Wiart répond d’abord à Me Palagî en lui rappelant un arrêt
                        Intervenu on 1893 an profit de la Compagnie du Canal de duquel il réaulte
                        que les tiers ont le droit indeniable d'examiner et de discuter les con</p>

                    <p>En ce qui concerne les moyens présentes par Mo Socoli, Me Carton de Wiart
                        confirme tout ce qui a été plaidé partie Le Moine. Il ajoute qu’il est
                        plaisant d’entendre los courtiers asso­ciés inviter M.M. Bustros h exercer
                        fa pro­fession do courtier en dehors de l’associaction, alors que les
                        règlements de cette asr sociation ne permettront jamais aux dits MM. Bustros
                        de , trouver la contre-parti e exigée par 1a loi et 1a jurisprudence, étant
                        donné qu'en fait les courtiers associés se sont défendus de traiter avec un
                        courtier libre. Me Carton de Wiàrt termine en disant que ce n’est pas le
                        tribunal qui va légi­férer, mais qu'au contraire le tribunal jugera que
                        c’est l’association qui a légiféré, alors que pour ce faire il lui eut fallu
                        l’autorisation du gouvernement et des puissances. L’association | a trouvé

                    <p>Me Le Moine réplique que, s’il est vrai que l’association des courtiers
                        n’existe pas en droit et qu’h ce point de vue il l’ignore, il est bien
                        obligé do la connaître en /ait, puitquo par son règlement elle no se

                        que les courtiers d’Alexandrie ont bien copié les règlements des coulissiers
                        de Paris niais, ce qui est inac­ceptable, c’est qu’er vertu de règlements

                    <head type="sub">THE INQUEST ON MR. BENSILUM.</head>
                    <p>The inquest on the late Mr. A. Bensilum was continued yesterday morning at
                        the British Consulate, Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Herz Bey, called as a witness, took the oath and stated that the deceased was
                        employed in his office from early in 1897 to November 29, 1904. Deceased was
                        an architect working under the Bureau du Comite des Monuments Arabes.
                        Witness had been ill, and alter returning from Helouan on the 26th November
                        last, found a letter from deceased tendering his resignation. He knew of no
                        reason for this. He had received two letters from the deceased in which he
                        excused himself for non attendance at the of­fice, giving various excuses,
                        followed by a formal letter of resignation. He saw the de­ceased, who gave
                        no reason and merely said that he was going to Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Questioned by the jury, witness stated that he bad not been altogether
                        satisfied with de­ceased's work, and quoted several cases in which he had
                        been forced to reprimand him for omissions and negligence of orders. On the
                        last occasion deceased said he would comply with the spirit if not the
                        letter of his in­structions. He had previously written to Dr. Sierra, an
                        uncle of the deceased, more than once. On this occasion, when he returned to
                        the office, which had been in deceased’s charge during absence of witness,
                        certain things had not been done, and the clerks said they would resign if
                        deceased was put in charge again. After bringing deceased’s conduct before
                        the committee he wrote to Dr. Sierra, saying that he wished to speak to him
                        about a relation. In reply to the question as to who it was, contained in
                        Dr. Siena’s answering letter, be wrote and put the facts before him, but on
                        receiving deceased’s letter tendering his re­signation he wired to Dr.
                        Sierra to consider witness’s second letter as null. His report to the
                        committee and complaints to Dr. Sierra could not have been known to deceased
                        before be gave his resignation. Deceased’s salary was L.E. 22 ; he began at
                        L.E. 13.</p>
                    <p>The jury brought in a verdict of suicide from despair, on which Mr. Alban,
                        who was presiding over the inquest, asked them to consider whether deceased
                        was compos mentis or not when he committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>The jury retired for consideration and gave a verdict of “suicide while
                        deceased was not responsible for his actions, owing to despair at his
                        non-success in his profession.”</p>

The proceedings openetion the 5th with a football match, in whienthe Port Saiders were beaten by 6 goals to niL Unfortunately, three of their originally select­ed team failed them at the last moment, and substitutes had to be played. There is very little doubt that if their full team had entered the lists, the result would have been a very even game. In the evening, after dinner at the E.T.C. quarters, a. billiard match was played. This, the K.T.C. won by 400 to 254 : the Port Saiders, after the long railway journey and the football, were evidently fatigued and did not play up to forn^ Tennis had been ar­ranged for the following afternoon, but, most regrettably, could not take place owing to the heavy rain. A bridge party was - started in the late afternoon, and was followed by a very enjoyable concert. Rumour has it that a return visit will shortly be made by the E.T.C.

                            <p>The teams were favored with a fine afternoon, and the field was in good condi­tion, although on the hard side for the Port Saiders, who are used to heavier ground. The visitors at the start forced the pace and for some time kept the E. T. C. backs very busy. The home team seemed *po eager and were unable to settle down. Doyle, on the left wing, and the brothers Howe, on the right, showed excellent form for Port Said, and were well hacked up by Wallace and Broatch at half. TbeyThowever, failed to score and offside against Mac Lean relieved the pressure. From the kick the home forwards obtained possession, and, after some play in front of the Port Said goal, Harris scored with a fine shot. The homesters were no* playing more steadily, and at this stage excellent play was shown by both teams. Unfortunately Tuns tall, in clearing, injured himself and had to be assisted off the field, leaving his side a man short : this was slightly counterbalanced by Hempson bruising a muscle, which prevented him from running and caused Pope to keep well back. Play was now of a give-and-take nature until shortly before the interval, when Harris, with a hard shot, struck the upright, and the ball rebound­ing into play, Templeman secured and scored. Port Said replied with a determined attack, Toms being called upon to clear : this he only partially did, as from his kick the ball hit MacLean in the face, rebounding just over the bar. The score at the end of the first 45 wa*
                            2 to nil in favour of the home team, although, on the play, the visitors were full value for a goal or two. On resuming Tunstall played goal, but was evidently suffering from his injured knee. The E.T.C. were now showing greatly improved form : both wings centering well: a corner was soon forced, and from a good kick by Evans, Humphreys headed through. Port Said now attacked strongly, Toms having to clear : the Port Said right wing was always dangerous, but their weakness in front of goal saved the home team. Good play by the E.T.C. left wing now followed, resulting in a goal by Harris. From the kick-off Port Said again attacked and the E. T. C. goal was in great danger : the pressure was relieved by a clearing kick and Mansell, obtaining the hall, shot: the ball glanced from the' defending back’s head through the goal. Some midfield play now followed, but shortly afterwards Harris raced through the defence and scored a brilliant goal. Another attack by the Port- Saiders followed, and after some good passing, MacLean put the ball through, but was given offside. No more scoring was done and the play was mostly midfield.

                            <p>To the Editor op the Earpmii Gazette.
                                Sir,—Having been a visitor to Assouan for several winters, I have read with interest the letter from your correspondent signed “H’ under the above heading in yonr issue of 31st ult, but with all deference I suggest that your correspondent has either been misled in the gathering of his- information, or has unfor­tunately only been partially aware of the facts of the matter. In the first place, he states that 'there is no trained nurse to be had without telegraphing to Cairo'.’: ever since the Cataract Hotel was built (and before then at the Grand) —Mr. Pagnon’s two hotels—a thoroughly trained English nurse has been domiciled, and in cases where the doctor considers her services needful, they are always to be had promptly and at moderate cost, by visitors to either of those hotels. Seoondly, I am rather afraid your correspondent’s letter would give the impres­sion that Assouan is entirely unprovided with the means of aooommodatiug anyone who may contract or develop such an illness as would render it advisable in the opinion of the medi­cal man for the patient to be isolated, except at the Native Hospital. I would like to point out, however, /that the two hotels mentioned above have always bod at their option rooms in the town of Assouan where such cases could be dealt with, and at tie present time have leased a complete houso, wbiob has been thoroughly equipped in every way for the nursing of the sick, and such patients whom it may be found necessary to accommodate in the said house would find the same comfort as if in the hotels, with the advantage of separate kitchen, etc., etc., if necessary, and visitors to either of thahotels referred to need anticipate no alarm at want of adequate accommidation in the unfortunate eveut of sickness.</p>
                            <p>1 shall be obliged if you can find space in four valuable-Coin mas for the insertion of this etter.</p>

                            <p>To the Editor or -Yak Eovptiaji Gazette.</p>
                            <p>Sir,—Nothing can be further from my wish than to do harm, however slight, to any society established and working for good. But I can truthfully say that the letter of .your cor­respondent 'A.C.C.” is the very first intima­tion 1 have had that good has been known to result from the operations of the C.O.8. in past years. On the other hand, condemnations in the London press of the methods adopted by the society have been so frequent as to pass almost unnoticed, and, as far as my own observation goes, have never been .challenged or replied to. The reputation the society bears in London is a most unenviable one, and its refusal to obtain assistanoe for really de­serving cases is proverbial. Many of these have come under my own notioe, and I speak from absolute knowledge of the facts.</p>
                            <p>A well-known philanthropist in this city recently told me that daring the 16 years he was employed as London City Missionary, not one case did be know of in whioh any help had been rendered to poor people through the ageucy of the society. But be knew of plenty of ritual* to assist deserving cases, for which he had to obtain the necessary help by his own efforts in other dtttinioni.</p>
                            <p>If it is urged that the aSSietyft work lies among the more refiued classwbo are in need if help, I know that the inquisitorial method* adopted and the conditions it attempts to im­pose before it will interest itself in needy cases are resented, and justly resented, in many cases by those who have been oompelled to sin* their pride and ask the C. 0. 8. to help them. /</p>
                            <p>I donji know that any good can be effected by cal;n!fg public attention to the society and its, dykign, and it might have been better for me to have omitted my reference to it. I only made it thinking that perhaps in such an extremity as I mentioned, this "Organisation” *ociety would feel that it was a oase in which they could freely, and without lengthened enquiry, render assistanoe. Many people though, who know the society better than I do, would perhaps considdTme tde sanguine</p> <p>I I am, etc.,</p>

                    <div type="item"><head>THE SUEZ CANAL.</head>
                        <p>In virw of the statements' which have recently aj.j cured in the English Press concerning the-h^avy dues charged by the Suez Canal, we have been at some pains to discover the incidence of the burden of which shipowners complain. Needless to say, Great Britain is the largest customer ot the company, but we doubt whether tbe average Englishman is aware that during 1903 the net tonnage of vessels flying the Union Jack traversing that waterway reached the enormous total of 7,404,000 tons, hr 62.2 per cent, of the total. As against this, our most powerful'rival on this route, Germany, could only show 1,773,000 tons, or 14.9 per cent. Tbe total net tounage on which the Canal company received dues in 1903 was 11,907,00!• ton*, which at 8.50 francs per ton produced £4,145,000, and of this £2,169,900 came out of the pockets of British shipowners in order that the shareholders might receive a dividend of 26 per cent! When the last year’s accounts are presented it will.be found that Che Canal company benefited from the passage of a portion of the Baitio Fleet to the extent of £14,700. This, we suppose, will also find its way iuto shareholders’ pockets.</p>
                        
                        <p>The promoter of tbe Thames barrage scheme claim s that the adoption ol the scheme would go a long way towards remedying the grievances of shipowners in connection' with the Suez Canal. The greatest depth of the canal is [ 26ft. 3iu. With a barrage at Gravesend, the Thames would be 30ft. deep. The difference in the draught would mean an extra eight thousand tons on the outward and inward voyages of the steamers whioh bring the wheat and other products from India. Now there is no absolute necessity for these vessels carrrying such homogeneous cargoes’, to go through the canal. They might as well take the Cape route, and with a 30ft. Thames the increased quantity they could carry would afford shippers and shipowners a much larger margin of profit They vlouid also do away with the canal dues, which they contend are too high. The saving in this respect would be enormous when it is considered that during the last eleven mouths the consignments of wheat and other products from India have been at the rate of over a million tons a month.</p></div>

                        <p>The Salt and Soda works at Mex were on Saturday the scene ol a gay assemblage of «veuilea and their friends, on the occasion of me annual Christmas fete and distribution of prizes. The gathering took place in one ot the argo buildings of the compauy, which w^s lecorated for the oocasion with an abundance' >i flags and tlural devices.

Mr. Friend presided, aud after the presentation of prizes me or two speeches, an excellent programme iias gone through. Tlie various items were ex-ieedmgly well rendered, the laughing song through the gramaphoae arousing much mirth, uid the mandolin and pianoforte duets evok-ug much applause. It seems, however, sorne-vhat iuvidious to select special items for com-nendation when all was so well done. The dis-ribution of gifts from the Christmas Tree con-luded a very enjoyable entertainment.</p>
