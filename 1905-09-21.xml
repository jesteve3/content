                The Swedo-Norwegian conference continues. While the main question, regarding the demolition CD the Norwegian fortresses and the eventual reference to arbitration of certain other questions, are virtually agreed upon, other knotty points are still unsettled, but it is believed that they will be adjusted satisfactorily. Meanwhile troops are kept in the neighbourhood of the frontiers. (Reuter)

                It is stated here that there is a hitch in the negotiations with regard to Morocco, due to the French anxiety for a precise definition of their special rights for policing the frontier. An authoritative Gorman statement declares that further serious difference is impossible.

                <p>We have pleasure in calling the attention of our readers to the splendid preparation of Messrs. Allen and Hanburys, Ltd., the celebrat-ed London chemists, which is being offered for sale under the title of "Allenburys’ Diet.” It would seem to be specially suitable for our climate, where the best of milk is not always obtainable. We are informed that Messrs. Allenburys’ Diet is a complete food in itself for invalids, convalescents, and the aged. It is very palatable, easily prepared, and when. taken before bed-time will be found to induce sleep. Allenburys’ Diet can be carried to advantage by tourists travelling at home or abroad. It is made in a minute, and is very easy of assimilation. [Advt.]

                <head>FEATURES OF CONCORDAT.</head>
                
                <p>A reprieve saves a prisoner from being hanged, it does not necessarily carry with it an order of his instant release from gaol. Such is the character of the concordat préventif ; it staves off a sudden and reverberating financial crash, but it may only delay a compulsory liquidation. In the case of the Sucreries, we hope for the sake of the country that the respite will enable the company to reorganise and recover, but while we recognise this pleasant possibility, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that nothing in the decision of the, Cairo Mixed Court can be taken as a guarantee that the compulsory winding-up of the company will not eventually become necessary. Article 206 (new) of the Mixed Code gives the terms on which a person or corporation is allowed to enjoy the benefit of the concordat préventif. Its chief features are these. The appointment by the tribunal of one of its members, the “juge commissaire” who takes and goes through the debtor’s books and finds his exact financial situation, decides under what conditions if any, the debtor can continue to do business, calls a meeting of the creditors, reads them a report on the situation, on the question of the debtor’s good faith and his proposals.
                </p>
                <p>Once the juge commissaire is appointed the debtor ceases payments by right.
                </p>
                <p>The names of the administrators under the concordat suggested by Maitre Carton de Wiart have been formally accepted by the Court. M. Debourg, we understand, will sign for his colleagues, Sir Elwin Palmer and Harari Pasha, during their absence.

We shall publish fuller details of both projects as soon as the negotiations now in progress are completed.

                <div type="item"><head>A DRAMA OF THE DESERT.</head>
               
               <p>In our issue of the 13st instant we mentioned that advice bad been received from Assiout by the Ministry of the Interior that two camel-men, accompanied by a policeman, who had left there the previous week, having in their charge some money for the pay of the police at the Oasis, bad been murdered, and that the policeman who returned to Assiout with the news was wounded in the bead. As the money was found intact it was at once seen that the motive for the crime could not have been robbery. An enquiry was at once instituted by the local Parquet and the mamour of the district, while a force of police was sent in search of the murderers who, the wounded policeman averred, were brigands. As no tracks could be found near the spot where the murders had been committed suspicion was aroused,and the policeman was suspected of having been guilty of the deed himself. It now appears that the latter was accompanied by his wife, and three traders also went with the caravan.
               </p>
               <p>From the evidence of the latter it now transpires that it was the policeman himself who shot the camelman, (not two as originally reported), in consequence of having discovered an intrigue between him and the woman. On hearing the report of a gun one of the traders rushed out of his tent to discover the cause, and was himself also shot dead. The medical man who examined the wounded policeman was of opinion that the wounds he bore in the head were self inflicted, and such turns out to be the case. This man, who is now in hospital, has been placed under arrest, and will be tried for the murders as soon as he is sufficiently recovered.

                <p>Night navigation is now permitted, subject to certain conditions as to the beams of vessels and their power, though it is at their captain’s own risk. The Bibby line Lancashire was, I believe, the first ship to avail herself of the permission, and she arrived here safely late on Monday night.
                </p>
                <p>Great interest is felt here in the coming of the members of the commission, some are to arrive to-morrow, but they will await the arrival of the “Chef du Transit” who comes on the M.M.Salazie. Rumours and wild stories are rife in the town regarding the various, proposals that have been made about the unfortunate Chatham, but I think I can safely say, that nothing is as yet decided nor will anything be until the gentlemen, whose arrival is so anxiously looked for, have carefully gone into the matter themselves.

Sirius, the second-class cruiser which is expected at Suez to-morrow, is to transit the Canal at once, provided she does not receive orders there to undertake the investigation and punishment of the offenders in the recent Red Sea piracies. It is currently reported here that her captain is to return south and go into this matter at once.
                </p>
                <p>The Sirius is a vessel of 3,600 tons displacement, having a speed of 19.75 knots and is armed with eight heavy guns.

                <p>The fete in honor of the unification of Italy which was held last night at the Alhambra Theatre was a great success. Baron Acton and most of the principal members of the Italian Colony were present, and the audience was most patriotic. After the opening of the fete with the National hymn, which was loudly applauded, an eloquent speech by Mr. Zucchi arroused the enthusiasm of all present The  pupils of the Conservatoire then gave a pretty rendering of an air by M. Colella, and then came the delightful comedy Nessuno va al campo and other historical pieces and recitations. The fireworks and, illuminations were capital, the charity bazaar and its lottery for the victims of the Calabrian Earthquake a great financial success, and the Khedive’s military hand with that of the Greeek Phil harmonic Society as well as the orchestra ably directed by Professor Gianni Galetti, were greatly appreciated. A vocal and instrumental concert with selections from La Poupee, Mascotte, Tosca, etc., and the performances of a conjuror-illusionist, finished the evening very pleasantly.

                <div type="item"><head>EGYPTIAN SILVER CURRENCY,</head>
                <p>To THE Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
                </p>
                <p>Sir,—With reference, to your article of the 21st ult., your leader writer appears to have so misunderstood some of the suggestions made by Mr. Roussin as to the rules to be followed in calculating the tature currency needs of Egypt, that I should like to be allowed to criticise the critique.
                </p>
                <p>The regulation of a token currency is a. comparatively simple matter, and does not give rise to the divergent theories that exist, for instance,  in the case of paper currency. This is because a token currency regulates itself, the rôle of the Government being confined in ordinary circumstances to the replenishment of its stock when it is getting low, as is done, for instance, in England.
                </p>
                <p>Something more than this is necessary in Egypt, because if the government waited till its holding began to get low, the new supplies could not be minted in time to meet the the demand. This makes itself felt at one season of the year only, i.e. during the cotton season in October, and November, while the silver takes three months to arrive from date of order. The instructions, to the Mint must therefore be given not later than July, supposing that it is necessary to make fresh provision.
                </p>
                <p>In July and August the Government hold ing reaches its maximum (i e. the. circulation reaches its minimum) so instead of ordering new supplies, when stock is running, low, the somewhat paradoxical rule of ordering that just at the moment when there is most in band has to be adopted.
                </p>
               <p> The data available for determining the amount to be ordered are as follows :
                </p>
                <p>1.	The demand for extra coin for the cotton crop includes and greatly exceeds the amount required to inorease the permanent circulation. The public takes what it wants for the cotton crop, retains what it necessary for increase in circulation owing to growth of population, etc., and returns the rest, when the marketing of the crop is practically over, into the hands of the Government. Thus last winter the public took out LE 360.000 in silver, of which the Government received book L.E. 200.000 daring the spring and summer of this year, the balance of LE 160.000 being retained as the permanent addition to the circulation. Hence it is obvious that there is not the slightest necessity to consider any of the points detailed by your leader-writer. The Government by providing for the cotton crop and for that alone, provides ipso facto much more than enough for all other contingencies.
                </p>
                <p>2.	The figures for past seasons show that the demand for the crop varies roughly according to its price, its quantity and the rapid-ity with which it is brought to market, But at the time it is necessary to order coin, none of, these factors can be foretold with any pretention to accuracy, and “keeping in touch with banks and markets” is of very little help. Therefore the only safe course is to presuppose a crop of maximum quantity at a very high price, and provide for that always.
               </p>
                <p>3. To do this it becomes imperative to fix the minimum, corresponding with the above-mentioned contingency, below which the Government reserve at the opening of the cotton season most not be allowed to descend. The experience of past years shows that even in season of record crop and prices, the expansion. in the winter circulation has never-reached £400,000. That amount has there fore been chosen as the irreducible minimum the Government must have in band. This rule is not a fixed one, since it does not prevent the Government from providing any amount over the minimum which it may deem advisable.
                </p>
                <p>Had this policy been initiated earlier, there would have been no impediment to the automatic self regulation of the currency, and no scarcity would have occured.—I am, Sir, etc.	Fiscal.

                <p>London. September 15th
                </p>
                <p>During the latter part of the week the Stock Exchange  has been occupied with the fort-nightly settlement, which has been an unusually heavy one, owing to the large increase in business which is now taking, place. The directors of the Bank of England decided on Thursday last to make no change in the Bank rate.  Pending their decision, prices were heavy, but as soon as it was known that they had made no alteration, buoyancy all round was the order of the day. The Bank returns show that notwithstanding the large withdrawals of gold, the reserve had only fallen ₤189,000 owing to the reflux of coin and notes from circulation here; and this now stands at. £24,506,000. There is still a feeing that the demand for gold for Egypt and South America must increase, and consequently it is thought probable that a higher rate will prevail in the autumn ; even a 4% rate should not be detrimental, as the signs of improvement in trade throughout the country are becoming more evident every day. Consols, which were as low as 895/8 rose to 8913/16 , and close to day at the latter price. In the foreign market, Japanese bonds were firmer on a good demand, the First Four-and-a-half percent rising 1/4 to 947/8  and the Second 1/8 to 33/4 premium. They leave off at 943/4 and 33/4 premium respectively  Russians remain unchanged, with the exception of a nominal rise of 11/3  in the Fives, Home Rails show little change on since last week, with the exception that Southern stocks have advanced slightly. The American market has been active with a reaction in prices which is considered only  natural after the recent advances. Reports from the United States are most optimistic both as regards the condition of the crops and the trade outlook. Consequently higher prices are looked for all round during the winter months.
                </p>
                <p>In the Egyptian section there has been some good buying of the shares of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The company, it is stated, has had an exceedingly profitable year, National  Banks are firm at 273/4  and Agricultural Banks maintain their prices at 14 5/8. A new franco-Egyptian Bank has been formed under English law, with a capital of £500,000 in £5 shares. The whole this amount has been placed and the £5 are now quoted on the Paris Bourse at 61/4. This bank is con-nected with the Credit Mobilier in Paris and the Credito Mobiliare in Italy. which was current in the early park of the week that Sir Ernest Cassel, was interested in the promotion with the idea of assisting the reconstruction of the Societe des Sucreries et Raffinerie d’Egypte is quite incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>Now that most of the parties interested in the above concern are in Cairo you will proba-bly be obtaining earlier information as to the course of events in connection with the ********** of this company ; the understanding here, however, is that it will be granted the benefit of the concordat preventif. The shares of the Daira Sugar Company are quoted today at 43/4.
                </p>
                <p>In the mining section the continued interest in Rhodesian shares has had a good effect on the market generally, and if this continues we shall see higher prices in almost all sections Nile Valle, to which we called attention when they stood, at 15/— have been as high 13/8 with good-buying, due to a belief in the satisfactory settlement of the Robinson interest and also to the report from the manager that a good crushing of 405 tons yielded 365 ounces of gold. The Egyptian Mines Exploration group are firm as the result of the development in the Semna mine of the Fatira Company particulars of which appear elsewhere.
