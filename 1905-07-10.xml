                        <p>—A notable of <placeName>Minieh province</placeName>, <persName>Sheikh

                            completely in his school career, and finally robbed his father of £200,
                            which he spent in riotous living. The remonstrances of the justly
                            indignant sheikh appear to have inspired the boy with the idea of
                            killing his father and sisters, and enjoying the family wealth at his
                            ease. He accordingly mixed powdered datura leaf with their food and when
                            asked to eat with them, refused. Within an hour of the meal, the sheikh
                            and his three daughters showed symptoms of datura poisoning. The
                            principal medical officer of the moudirieh was called in, and
                            recognising the symptoms, asked the son why he would not eat with his
                            family. His answers proving unsatisfactory, the boy was searched and the
                            poison found in his pockets. The sheikh and his daughters, who are still
                            dangerously ill, have been sent to the <placeName>hospital at

                        <p>Commenting on the news of the very serious illness of the Grand Mufti,
                                <persName>Sheikh Ali Youssef</persName>’s organ, “Al Moayad,” writes
                            “We give with the deepest regret and most poignant grief the sad news
                            that has reached us of the Grand Mufti’s health. It has proved
                            impossible to convey the patient to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> owing
                            to the increasing gravity of his illness. His many friends and relations
                            are making the most anxious enquiries concerning him. We hope heaven
                            will grant him recovery and a long life.”</p>
                        <p>As we go to press we hear that the Grand Mufti’s condition shows signs of
                            improvement.</p>

                        <p>We hear that <persName>Mohamed Bey Saleh</persName>, President of the
                                <placeName>Assiout</placeName> Court of 1st Instance, has submitted
                            a memorial to the Acting Regent, to the Judicial Adviser, and to the
                            President of the Court of Appeal. In the memorial he claims that his
                            judicial dignity has been offended by the language used by <persName>Aly
                                Bey Abou el Fatouh</persName>, who represented the
                            Procureur-General, and by <persName>Morcos Effendi Fehmy</persName>,

                            Appeal. The memorial demands that <persName>Morcos Effendi
                                Fahmy</persName> should be brought before a council of discipline on
                            the ground of the aspersions cast by him on the character of the Assiout
                            Court. <persName>Mohamed Bey Saleh</persName> is said to have stated
                            that he would far rather resign his position than be exposed to such
                            attacks on his dignity and that of his colleagues, and see the
                            independence of the judges made a mere name.</p>

                        <dateline><placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Sunday.</dateline>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Messageries S.S. “Polynesien” arrived from
                                <placeName>Aden</placeName>, at which port she had taken on board
                            250 of the survivors the Wreck of the “Chadoc,” which was lost! on ÷ on
                            26th June. The S.S. “Iraouaddy,” of the same company, has just arrived
                            from the canal, haying on board the remaining 360, all of whom were
                            picked up by the Russian Volunteer cruiser “Rion” (ex “Smolensk”) on the
                            1st inst, and landed at Aden, at which port the “Rion” was obliged to
                            coal, she having burned all her woodwork and fittings to enable her to
                            reach <placeName>Aden</placeName>. </p>
                        <p>In an interview which I had with two of the passengers of the “Chadoc,” I
                            learned that the vessel went ashore at 4 a.m. close under Guardafui on
                            the 26th ulto. and that most of the ship’s boats were broken
                                <placeName>up</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>The Somalis, many of whom spoke French, having served in the “Haussas,”
                            took the whole number, including 80 children, off the vessel, only one
                            being lost in the rescue operations. The passengers in many cases were
                            able to save their personal effects, and the steward’s department to
                            disembark a quantity of provisions. The natives built them rude huts of
                            twigs and gorse and treated them all with considerable kindness, which
                            belies the general idea entertained that the men of that coast are utter
                            savages.</p>
                        <p>After four days spent in the village, they were able to attract the
                            attention of the “Rion” by means of a signal staff erected on a
                            sand-hill to the north of the Cape and were all embarked (save one, who
                            was lost two days before) on the Russian vessel, arriving at Aden all
                            well on the morning of the 4th July.</p>
                        <p>By the “Polynesien” there also arrived 190 Russian refugees, who were
                            transferred to the S.S. “Tchihatchoff,” which vessel sailed last night
                            direct for <placeName>Odessa</placeName>.</p>

                        <head>A LOCAL SCANDAL.</head>
                        <p>Some two months ago, I noted the destruction of the “Bains Minerve” and
                            the refusal of the authorities to allow a syndicate to build a similar
                            place on account of the reputation which it had gained. Since then, land
                            has been let in large quantities for the erection of bath houses on the
                            beach, and now, instead of the gambling and so on being carried on in
                            one large building, there are at least 20 or 30 in which the wildest of
                            orgies take place nightly. Not content with that, the whole line of
                            beach is now filthy in the extreme and a grave menace to health—and the
                            police do not see that which is plain to every resident.</p>

                        <head>WATER POLO. R. A. M. C. v. ALEX. SWIMMING CLUB.</head>
                        <p>This fixture was brought off on Saturday afternoon at Rs-el-Tin in lovely
                            weather and before a good turn-out of spectators, both on shore and in
                            boats surrounding the enclosure. The R. A. M. C. started the game with
                            the sun in their eyes and after some near passing Ames got through the
                            defence and opened the score by a high-placed goal, the ball just
                            clearing the cross-bar, in favor of his team. Halftime arrived with a
                            score of one goal to the R A M. C.</p>
                        <p>On resuming, the club team carried the ball down field and for a time the
                            game was confined to the homesters’ goal. Some neat and exciting passing
                            now took place and Ecclestone, clearing, put a well-placed goal in, thus
                            bringing the club’s team score to one. Fast play was now witnessed, the
                            R. A. M.C. . trying hard for the conqueror, but time was celled, the
                            score remaining one all.</p>
                        <p>The following were the teams R.A.M.C.: Steele, Cruise, White, Bright,
                            Ames, Benn, Adams being in goal. Alexandria Swimming Club: Wood,
                            Hewgill, Mace, Darton, Ecclestone, and Webb in goal. Referee: Q. M. S.
