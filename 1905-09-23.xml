                It is semi-officially announced that it is still believed that the negotiations regarding Morocco will lead to an understanding, but that owing to German demands and objections, especially with regard to policing the frontiers and financial arrangements the agreement will not be concluded as soon as was anticipated.

Though Professor Bellini’s efforts may fail to convince, they are certainly most remarkable, and very interesting.

                </p>
                <p>Early in April 1904, in the very week of the Anglo French agreement concerning Morocco and Egypt, Moulai Abd-el-Aziz engaged a troupe of singers and dancing women under the charge of Moursi Barakat. At the time we remarked that the political and financial situation of Morocco, and above all the internal condition of the country, made us inclined to doubt the news. But we saw the first-class tickets of the troupe, which, by the way, was not the best that Cairo could produce, and we could only express our hope that its harmonies might aid the Sultan to forget his troubles, and bring about friendly relations between Morocco and Egypt Our hopes, however, were vain, and this cure for political anxiety has evidently not been lasting, for once again Moulai Abd el Aziz has engaged the same troupe, this time to calm the agitation aroused by the Emperor William’s visit to Tangiers, and the arrival of one diplomatic mission after another.
                </p>
                <p>The troupe numbers eight persons, as on last year's visit (For the benefit of oar readers we give their names and rôles :—Moursi Barakat, impresario, Badia, prima donna and chief danseuse, Zobeida, eccentric danseuse and comedienne , Zeinab singer and danseuse, Hassan Badri, tenor, Saleh Mohamed, musician, Hassan Ali player of the "oud” and Fangari, chief of the claque.) Even if we can understand the rôle of the first seven members of the troupe it is a little difficult to account for Fangari’s presence, unless the claqueur is summoned to shoot down the protests of M. St Réné Taillandier, or to keep Count von Tattenbach in order.

                The M.M. Salazie arrived at dawn to-day, having on board M. Tillier, the Chef du Transit, who comes specially to take the chair and direct matters in connection with the unfortunate Chatham incident. Soon after his disem-barcation, a consultation was held at which the heads of Canal Co’s departments assisted. Mr. Harris the special representative of Nobell’s factory was also present, and I understand a decision was arrived at which will become public property very shortly.
                </p>
                <p>On Wednesday after the party had returned from the Chatham, a lengthy meeting was held in the Chief Engineer’s office, but no final decision leaked out, nor has any done so, so far, to-day.

                <p>The position of the vessel is the same practically as it was when last I sent notes on the subject except that she is settling down more or less. All sorts of preparations have been made, and from the appearance of things I would not be surprised to bear of something important very soon, when I will communicate with yon.

               <p> From what I learn from various sources I believe it is finally decided to blow the vessel up some time next week, and looking at things from a general point of view, although the actual date is not known, my opinion is it will not occur until after the passage of the Brindisi mail boat

                <p>(By Telegraph)
                </p>
                <p>Saturday, 9.30 a.m.
                
                Yesterday’s meeting of the commission of experts in consultation with the heads of the various departments of the Canal Company, finally decided that it would be necessary to blow up the Chatham. I understand that the explosion will not take place till Thursday, in order to let the Caledonia pass safely through with the mails, for India and Australia . A deviation in the fresh water canal is now being constructed as rapidly as possible with a view to minimise the danger to Port Said’s water supply. The explosion will be effected by means of electricity and troops have been ordered up from Cairo.
                </p>
                        <p>The blowing up of the Chatham with a cargo of probably more than 100 tons of dynamite, will constitute a world’s record in the history of dynamite explosions. The last record was created at Aboukir, near Alexandria, on the 1st June of the present year, when sixteen and a half tons of dynamite were exploded by Mr. Harris under the orders of the Municipality. No one oau have any conception as to what the force of such an explosion can be ; its consequences may be grave, and it is impossible to say where they will end.
                </p>
                <p>The S.S. Chatham lies about nine miles from Port Said and though perhaps no serious damage will result to the town itself, it is safe to prophecy that a severe shock will be felt, and that windows will be broken, whilst we should imagine that it is quite possible that some of the flimsily built native houses may be damaged. The railway line is in close proximity to the sunken vessel, the rails will probably be loosened, and traffic temporarily suspended. Beyond the damage which will be done to the canal itself, the moat important question to be considered is the danger to the fresh water canal from which Port Said draws the whole of its water supply. The Canal Company is indeed making every effort to avert, or at any rate minimise, this danger by cutting a deviation, but it is almost too much to hope that the fresh water canal will escape destruction at this point, though the work of repair will be much more quickly accomplished than in the case of the maritime canal, and it is to hoped that should Port Said be deprived of fresh water it will only be for a short time.
                </p>
                <p>As regards the effect of the explosion on the ship canal, it is impossible to estimate the extent of the damage. The banks will be blown to pieces for a considerable distance and the canal will, we imagine, be entirely blocked for some three weeks at the least, This will involve the accumulation of 150 vessels or more at either end of the canal, and the loss to trade can well be imagined, for not only will the shipping firms suffer, but those who are awaiting the arrival of cargoes. The mails most, of course, be delayed for as short a time as possible and we suppose that arrangements will be made, whereby they will be conveyed from Port Said to Suez, and vice-versa, by rail, and there re-shipped by other vessels at either end.

                <p>The gala performance held at the Eldorado Theatre on Wednesday, proved a great success, and was largely attended. Two pieces were given by the company, both being exceedingly well received ; they were in Italian. The financial results of the evening were, I believe, most satisfactory, subscriptions having amounted to a very considerable sum, not only from the sale of tickets, but by money-gifts from various residents. The entire committee were present at the performance, and a large number of the British residents attended to swell the already large number in the auditorium.

                H. H. the Khedive while at Vienna paid a visit to the celebrated choral society of Vienna. The president and committee thanked the Khedive most heartily for the honor he had done them, and his Highness replied with a brief extempore speech in which he praised the artistic abilities of the choral society, and particularly mentioned the excellent impression they had left in Egypt- The Khedive then visited the society's museum, which contains a cup presented by the King of Hanover, medals given by Napoleon III., the looks of Mozart's hair, and autograph letters of Weber, Wagner, Meyerbeer, Johann Strauss, and many other famous musicians. On leaving he promised to visit the choral society whenever be passed through Vienna.

The new line will ply between the various Levantine ports, Alexandria of course included. M. N. Boyiajides, who has been sent to London on a mission which comprises the purchase of vessels, reports that he has just added another steamer, displacing 2,500 tons, to the company's fleet. Meantime M. Giovannidis’ new navigation company, which has started an agency at Rhodes, is on the look oat for steamers to add to its flotilla. The Melpomene is already running between Alexandria and Rhodes, and I expect that other vessels will soon he employed on this service.

               <p> To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
                </p>
                <p>Sir, — Having considerable experience of ocean travel in different parts of the world, a recent journey home has served to put life into an old grievance, on which I take the liberty of addressing yon.
                </p>
                <p>One hears from time to time of the waning popularity of this or that line of passenger steamers, and confident that the directors of such lines have the interests of their shareholders at heart, I make the following suggestions which if carried out, will, I think, tend to their reinstatement in the public favour.
                </p>
                <p>In brief, Sir, I recommend that a speciality be made of the tea served to passengers.
                </p>
                <p>After one’s morning tub and in the afternoons could one depend upon a cup of good tea daintily served what a boon, it would be !
                </p>
                <p>How popular such a line would become with the fair sex. The harsh memory of many a rough passage would be softened by the reflection "But they did give us delicious tea !”
                </p>
               <p> A cow or cows should be carried or, failing that, the best brands of sterilised milk, and if macaroons were served with the afternoon tea success would be assured,
                </p>
                <p>You will observe, Sir, that I have refrained from mentioning any particular line of steamers ! This reticence on my part is not prompted by a desire to spare any one’s feelings. It arises from the knowledge that they are all tarred with the same brush in respect to the fault to which I take exception.
                </p>
                <p>I am, Sir, etc.
