Prince Abbas from Turkey yesterday, a number of boatmen, porters, hotel runners and others rushed on board, while Europeans wishing to meet friends had to wait. M.

The lad, who was only twelve years of age, had been missing from his home for three days, and the grief of the parents, at finding that the child has been the victim of foul play, is great. The police are making every effort to find some trace of the criminal, but up to the present they have met with no success.

    <p>The Ibrahimieh Casino.—The performance at the variety theatre of the Casino, lbrahimieh, on Monday was noted for the début of M. Gaspard and Mlle. Néva, who sustained the reputation which they have brought with them from other countries. These artistes sing duets of a light vein in an attractive manner, and introduce a good deal of dancing, of which art both are good exponents. Mlle Néva has a pleasing voice, and is a very sprightly dancer, and M. Gaspard is an excellent humourist. The items provided by these duettists, added to the rest of the programme, constitute a good all-round evening’s entertainment.

</p>
    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain farther particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.

<div type="item"><head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
<head>THE CONCORDAT PREVENTIF.</head>

<p>The application of the Sucreries and Raffinerie d’Egypte to be allowed the benefit of the concordat ’préventif came before the Commercial Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Court yesterday morning. The court was naturally full, the Cairo Bar and Press being well represented. The Court was composed of Mr. Somerville Tuck, presiding Judge, Messrs. Rassim Bey, Boustros, Montan, and Coghlan, Judges, M. Beer and Hussein Effendi Gallal, assessing Judges, Maher Bay, substitute, and M. Zigliara, greffier. After eight unimportant bankruptcy oases had been disposed of, Maître Carton de Wiart rose to plead that the Sucreries Company should be allowed the benefit of the concordat préventif. After recounting the origin of the company and describing its development, he pointed out that the feeling of the creditors was all in favour of the granting of the concordat as the beet solation for themselves and for the company. He cited numerous authorities in support of his contention that a joint-stock company can demand the application of the concordat and that its directors are at fall liberty to state the balance without calling any general meeting of shareholders. As to the question whether the company was in debt, all depended on the question whether it was to be held responsible for the agreements entered into by the late M. Cronier in its name. If so, it was in debt without question, but not otherwise.
</p>
<p>Then came the question of the good faith of the directors. There was no reason to doubt it, for they, like the rest of the world had entire confidence in the agreement made by the firm Henri Say to guarantee the sums for bills discounted. In previous balance sheets the bills accepted by the company were balanced by the say guarantees and these balance sheets had been unanimously approved by the shareholders. Under these circumstances the conduct of the directors could not be impugned.
</p>
<p>Turning to the interests involved, the speaker called the attention of the court to the disastrous results that would follow a declaration of bankruptcy. The agricultural population of a large tract of Upper Egypt, and the employé of the company would suffer terribly and their losses would react most injuriously opon the general prosperity of Egypt.
</p>
<p>Should the directors be found to have acted in a manner unauthorised by the statutes of the company, proceedings might be taken against them in, the future, bat this was not a question for the moment. A provisional arrangement was required in the interests both of the company and its creditors. The names of Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Debourg, the proposed administrator under the concordat, were a good guarantee of a successful solution.
</p>
<p>The speech ended a few minutes before 11 a.m. and Maher Bey rose to speak on behalf of the court. He was also in favour of the application of the concordat, but reserved the right, after the examination of the company's books and the expert’s report thereon, to demand that the company should be wound up and its directors—if necessary—prosecuted. The court then retired to deliberate, leaving the audience to discuss the situation and to congratulate Maître Carton de Wiart on his admirable speech. At 12.55 a.m. the court returned and the judgment was read granting the concordat Preventif. It ran as follows :
</p>
<p>“ Le ministère public entendu, nomme M. Tuck, président de la Chambre, jage commissaire à l’effet de procéder aux opérations édictées par la loi en conformité des dispositions de l’article206 (nouveaucode), dépens réservés; ordonne à la Société des Sucreries d'avoir dans les huit jours du prononcé du présent jugement à déposer au greffe ses livres et pièces comptables. "
</p>
<p>The general impression in the audience was one of unalloyed satisfaction. It was felt on all sides' that the granting of the concordat was the only possible solution of the present crisis that would satisfy creditors and shareholders and stave off a disastrous crash. Maître Helou who appeared as counsel for a group of Alexandrian shareholders declined to speak, after the remarks made by Maher Bey with whom he entirely agreed, and the bar was obviously under the impression that the only course that could reconcile a number of conflicting individual interests had been followed by the court.
</p>

<p>(By Telephone).</p>

<p>To-day by the order of Judge Somerville Tuck the Sucreries were authorised to continue their business, bat under the control of Sir E Palmer, Harari Pasha and M. Eugène Debourg. The meeting of creditors will take place on October 4 at 10 a.m. under the presidency of Judge Took, at the Mixed Tribunals, Cairo.

<p>London, September 19.

The writer George Macdonald, LL.D. is dead.	(Reuter)

George Macdonald, the celebrated poet and author has passed away at the ripe age of 81. Of late years his name has not been very prominent in the literary world, and living abroad, he only paid annual visits to England. Daring the latter half of the last century he was, however, a power in the land, and such books of his as the "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood,” “Guild Court,” “Robert Falconer,” and others were highly appreciated, especially by those in sympathy with his advanced theological views. As a poet he ranked high in the public estimation, and his occasional appearances in the pulpit always drew large congregations.

Dr Macdonald was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in 1824, and was educated at the parish school there, and at King’s College and University, Aberdeen. After taking his degree he became a student for the ministry at the Independent College, Highbury, London, and was for a short time an Independent minister, bat soon retired, became a lay member of the Church of England, and settled in London to pursue a literary career. His first work was "Within and Without, a Dramatic Poem,” 1856 ; followed by "Poems,” 1857 ; "Phantasies, a Faerie Romance,” 1858; “David Elginbrod,” 1862; "Adela Cathcart,” 1864; •The Portent, a Story of Second Sight,” 1864 ; “Alec Forbes of Howglen,” 1865 ; "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood,” 1866; “Guild Court,” 1865; The Disciple and other Poems,” 1868 ; "The Seaboard Parish,” 1868 ; "Robert Falconer,”1868; "Wilfrid Cumbermede,” 1871; 'The Vicar's Daughter,” "Malcolm,” 1874; "St. George and St. Michael” 1875; "Thomas Wingfield, Curate,” 1876 ; "The Marquis of Lossie,” 1877. "Sir Gibbie,” 1879; "The Diary of an Old Soul ”1880; "Castle Warlock,” 1882; "Weigh-ed and Wanting,” 1882 ; "The wise woman,” 1888; "There and Baok,” 1891; "Heather and Snow,” 1893 ; "Lilith,” 1895 ; "Salted with Fire,” 1897; "Rampolli,” 1897. Besides these Dr. Macdonald has written books for the young : "Dealings with the Fairies,'' 1867 ; Ranald Bannerman’s Boyhood,” 1869 ; "The Princess and the Goblin,” 1871 ; “At the Back of the North Wind,” 1870 ; and others. He is also the author of "Unspoken Sermons,” 1866 ; and a treatise on the "Miracles of our Lord,” 1870. In 1877 he received a Civil List pension of £100, in consideration of his contributions to literature. Among his well-known works should be mentioned. "The Gifts of the Child Christ,” and other poems, 2 vols., 1882 ; and "The Princess and Cardie,” a fairy romance, 1882.

<p>Suakin, September 13.

Mr. Urquhart, bridge contractor for the Suakin-Atbara line arrived by the Khedivial Mail S S. Dakahlieh and brought with him a number of workmen to replace those whose contracts have expired. Kaimakam Longfield Bey, RE, left for Railhaed on the 11th inst., and will meet Kaimakam Midwinter Bey, RE, and .discuss with him several matters, including the question of what is to be done with the surplus material which remains over from that brought out for the construction of the Suakin-Atbara line.

<p>The work of erecting the new railway bridge at Zifta will shortly be commenced, a large quantity of material having recently arrived from France. This bridge is to be constructed by Messrs. Dayde and Pillé who are one of the three firms whose designs for the Rodah bridges were finally selected, out of a large number that were sent in and submitted to the Ministry of Public Works for final decision, with the resalt as our readers are aware, that the tender of Messrs. Sir William Arrol and Co. was accepted. The new bridge will be to the north of Zifta, between that town and the barrage, and will serve for the new line from Tantah to Zagazig. When this bridge is completed, next year, the same firm will commence the construction of three others, one on the Damietta branch of the Nile, and the other two on the Tewfikieh and Menoufieh canals respectively.

<div type="item"><head>THE COMING TOURIST SEASON.</head>
<p>Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son have just issued their annual illustrated handbook for the Nile services for the coming winter, which will be practically the same as those of last season. Their steamers will begin to ran between Cairo and the First Cataract on the 3rd November and continue until the 23rd of March, with later connecting steamers between the First and Second Cataracts. A new feature, to which we call attention, is the arrangement of combined bookings by Messrs. Cook’s steamer and the Egyptian and Sudan Railways, enabling tourists with only limited time at their disposal to make their visits to Upper Egypt and the Sudan more rapidly than can be done by using the steamers only. Combined tickets are issued as far as Gondokoro, a Uganda, to which there is a Government steamer service once a month from Khartoum by up-to-date boats fitted with electric light, hot and cold baths, etc.

<p>Messrs. Cook will charge specially reduced rates for residents in Egypt daring November and December.
