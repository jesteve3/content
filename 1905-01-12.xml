                    <p>Oar telegrams to-day state that the Japanese fleet are rumoured to have already got half-way aoroes the Indian Ocean, for Diego Garcia, where they are said to have reached, is the southernmost of the Chagoo Islands, a little British archipelago, almost doe South of the Maldives. The same</p><cb n="5"/>
                    <p>telegram, which was despatched yesterday from Port Louise, Mauritius, announces that Admiral Rodjestvensky has been in-1 formed of the fact that the Japanese are on the way to meet his fleet, and the Russia^ have consequently redoubled their vigilance. The only ohanoo for the Russians is to dodge the Japanese. Rodjestvensky’s nearest Russian port is Vladivoetock, distant 7,300 miles, vift the Straits ot Sunda. From Sainte Mary to the western entrance to the Straits of Malacca is 3,300 miles, and to the Straits of Sunda 3,600, aud unless he is prepared to proceed by an even more circuitous route, he will be obiigeu to pass through one of these two intricate and narrow entrances to the waters oi the Far East. Nothing except a few useless coral reefs, all of which, by the way, belong to England, lie between Madagascar aud Sumatra, and coaling in the Indian Ocean in these latitudes would be, to say the least of it, a most difficult, if not impossible, evolution. Yet from the moment that he arrives at one of the two alternative doors to the Far East, Rodjdat-venaky’s troubles, so far as the Japanese are concerned, begin.	Already Admiral
                        
                        Kamimura’s cruisers and destroyers are haltway across the Indian Ocean, and it is under stood that his forces have been supplemented by a number of armed merchant cruisers, whose special duty; it will be to prey upon the colliers and transports attend ing the Russian fleet*. Nevertheless, even the battleships must be coaled eta route if they hope^ever to reach Vladivostock, and if they are deprived of their resources in this direction they beoomo as helpless hulks upon the ocean.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether Admiral Rodjestvensky purposes to oouoentrato his first, second, and supplementary divisions at Madagascar, or whether he intends to approach Sumatra with his forces divided, aud outer the Malacca Straits aud the Straits ot Sunda simultaneously, is, for the present, a •matter of secondary consideration. His supplementary divisiou is still pottering about Suex; and we may take it for certain that his own division is sadly b need of refit/In what overdirectiou he turns, that blaokspectre" Coal" confronts him and paralyses his action. Nut one single vessel iu his combined fleet is free from it—neither his battleships, nor the last cruisers ot his second divisiou, uor his destroyers. What could be done, out of sight of the world, at Dakar and Mossamedes cannot be done at Madagascar, or at Batavia, the threshold of the Far East. Any infringement of neutrality now that the Russian fleet is abo.it to euter hostile waters will be bitterly and promptly resented by Japan. And rightly so.. For the whole of bar naval strategy is based upon the striot observance of the laws of neutral nations, and auy infringement of them caunut fail to have the moet serious aud far-reaching ooneequences.</p></div><cb n="6"/> </div>

With this in their possession the two started on their trip: The father quickly apprised the police, who telegraphed to the various moudiriehs a description of the delinquents. The latter had made for Edfu, but on their way alighted at Keneh, in order to spend some of their money there. Here they attracted the attention of a detective and were arrested by him.

                        <p>(From our Special Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>Port Said, Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>The long-expected squadron has at last arrived here. Though due to arrive at dawn, and passed in the night by the British S.S. “Scot,” a ship of 10 knots which arrived here at 10 a.m., the fleet was not off the port until 2.30 p.m. The P. and O. mail steamer “Egypt" arrived oft the port at the same time, and had to give precedence to the warships, but no doubt the interesting event compensated the. passengers for the delay.</p>
                            <p>The day was fine and bright, a light northwest wind was blowing, and the sea was smooth ; but notwithstanding this the two protected cruisers of the fleet rolled heavily, even when, to some extent, under the lee of the breakwater. This defect has been noticeable in nearly all the Russian warships that have passed through the canal, and it must be a serious handicap to their gunnery practice in a seaway.</p>
                            <p>A considerable number of people gathered along the front to watch the passage of the ships, and many cameras were in evidence, the probability of most of these ships being sent to the bottom before long no doubt acting as an incentive to collect souvenirs.</p>
                            <p>A large number of Russian spies have been noticed in the town for some days. Weird, unkempt-looking individuals, they loaf about the cafés in an aimless way, day and night, doing nothing, for there is certainly not the slightest work for them to do here. Precautionary measures have, it is true, been taken by the authorities ; but not to the same elaborate extent as before, and the spirit of the officers in charge of these duties is that of an amused participator in a harmless pantomine.</p>
                            <p>The first vessels of the fleet to enter the harbour were two of the destroyers, followed closely by the flagship "Oreg.” Another destroyer followed, then came the second-class cruiser "Izumrund,” followed by the Volunteer Fleet ships "Rion” and ‘‘Dnieper.’’ These last two vessels are, respectively, our old friends the "Smolensk" and “Petersburg,” which passed the Dardanelles under the merchant and Red Cross flags and seized, amongst other ships, the P. and O. steamer “Malacca.” The new names they bear, and the coat of dark grey paint, are no doubt a concession to England’s vigorous protest, followed by the demonstration made in these waters in July last by eight battleships of our Mediterranean Squadron, on account of the breach of the Treaty of Paris.</p>
                            <p>The "Rion” and “Dnieper” look smart and well-kept, but the “Oreg” and “Izumrud,” notwithstanding the fact that they are comparatively new ships, look rather seedy, and do not strike one as having been in dry-dock of late.</p>
                            <p>The fleet will prove a useful reinforcement to Admiral Rodjestvensky, for, as will be seen from the following particulars, they are all fast and well-armed ships :—</p>
                            <p>“Oreg.” Flagship. 1st class protected cruiser. Speed 23 knots. Guns: 12 six inch, 12 three-inch, 8 three pounders, 2 1 pounders. Two submerged torpedo tubes, and 2 torpedo tubes above water-line.</p>
                            <p>“Izumrud. ’ 2nd class protected cruiser. Speed 22.5 knots. Guns : 6 4 7, 8 three-pounders, 5 torpedo tubes above water line.</p>
                            <p>“Rion.” Speed 19 1/2 knots. Guns : 8 4 7, 8 three-pounders, 4 one-pounder, 2 Maxims.</p>
                            <p>“Dnieper. ’ Speed 19.5 knots. Guns: 8 4 7., 6 3-inch, 3 Maxims.</p>
                            <p>Three destroyers of similar class, 350 tons diplacement each. Speed 26 knots.</p>
                            <p>From these details it will be seen that the fleet is a scouting, rather than a fighting, force, two of the cruisers having no protection whatever. The other two, having only armoured decks and gun shields, could not hope to successfully engage the powerful armoured cruisers of Japan.</p></div>

Zarifi, has accepted the post of adviser to the bank.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to what was announced, it is now stated that no shares whatsoever are to be issued, the capital of ten million francs having been wholly subscribed by the two banks interested, the National of Greece and the National of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The manager of the Hellenic National Bank has arrived here from Athens, where he was lately received by King George, who expressed his satisfaction at the co-operation of the two banks. The agency in Constantinople will be placed under the superintendence of a committee composed of M. E. Engénidés, M. S. Zarifi, and M. T. Mavrogordato, of our city.</p>
                        <p>A London financial correspondent sends us the following information on the same subject:</p>
                        <p>—Considerable interest attaches to the formation of the “Orient Bank" by the National-bank fur Deutschland and the Banque Nationale de Gréce. The capital will be Fr. 10,000,000 (gold), of which each of the founder institutions takes one-half. The seat of the new bank will be Athens, but its chief field of operations will be Turkey, Asia Minor, and Egypt, its principal business the financing of the export and import trade. It is believed that the assistance of the German institution will be of special value in Turkey, where German influence is at present paramount.</p></div>

                    <p>Last June Mohamed Said Pasha, wekil of the Daira of Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha, issued the following notice on behalf of the estate, which was published in all the newspapers of Alexandria ;—</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Mohamed Said Pasha, wekil of the Daira of the late Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha, informs the public that, in view of the popular complaints against the in-increase of the rents in Alexandria, of the smallness and paucity of business at present, and of the duty of all honorable people in the common interest and of the benevolent feelings which should animate this question, the family of the late Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha have decided, in the interests of humanity and in solicitude for the poor, not to increase the rents of their property.</p>
                    <p>The generosity of this brought forth a great deal of laudation, as such conduct was so different from that which generally characterises the Alexandrian landlord. The moderation and philanthropy were praised to the skies and the course adopted was pointed out as an example to others. The Sheikh promised the Tenants Commission that he would also do his best to urge other landlords to exercise the same moderation.</p>
                    <p>This, however, appears to have been a practical joke on the part of the owner, for they have recently informed their tenants that their rents would be raised, and the additions that are being made to the rents are furthermore very excessive.</p></div>

                    <head type="sub">PROMISES TO BE A RECORD ONE</head>
                    <p>We are informed that the managers of the hotels in the Capital, as well as at Helouan, Mena House, and up-river, are jubilant at the large number and class of tourists that are already crowding all the winter resorts of Egypt, and there are unmistakable signs in all directions that the present will prove to be the record season, surpassing even the last, which was considered the best so far.</p>
                    <p>As an instance, we may say that at one of the leading Cairo hotels,—the Grand Continental,—there was a daily average during the month of November of no less than 120 visitora more than during the corresponding month of the previous year, and for December the daily number was even greater. Shepheard’s has been crowded for weeks, and the other fashionable hostelries, the Savoy and Ghezireh Palace Hotels, are also filling up rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The smaller hotels everywhere report the same good news, and the managers aver that never before have their houses been full so early, despite the large number of tourists that have already left for the Nile trip and Khartoum.</p></div>

                    <p>In regard to the stories about the attack on some tourists by Bedouins at Sakhara which have been appearing in the Cairo newspapers, we hear on high authority that there is a good deal to be said on the other side. An official enquiry is about to be held, and we will refrain from commenting on the affair as it is sub-justice. Some of our contemporaries seem to us to have been a little too hasty in assuming that the fault was entirely on one side.</p></div>

                    <p>We hear that the new regulations for the registration of dogs are almost completed. We welcome the news and hope that no misguided Europeans will attempt to take shelter behind the Capitulations, and to avoid compliance with a measure dictated by common prudence.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.</head>
                    <p>We would desire to draw attention to the prominence given to the Ministry of Public instruction in the Note recently published by the Financial Adviser. The budget for 1905 has been increased by L.E 31,300 over that of 1904. This is a gratifying feature and, with out doubt, will tend towards a general improvement of the education of the country. Hitherto young educated Egyptians have found it more profitable to pursue their higher studies for qualification in Medicine, Law, and the more liberal professions. Teaching as a profession did not seem to offer many adequate prizes ; but we have no hesitation in stating that a perusal of the table of salaries issued by the Ministry will turn the thoughts of many Egyptian parents towards the adoption of the teaching profession for their sons.</p>
                    <p>From this table we observe that L.E.16,360, which represents the sum specified in the Financial Adviser's Note for the improvement in the status of the staff, together with other money disposable for the same purpose, or rather more than half the total increase of the budget for 1905, will be devoted to advance the position of such officials as are engaged in school-work. To this substantial addition must also be added the increases of salary accorded by the Ministry each year in the month of January.</p>
                    <p>Admission to the higher posts held by teachers
                        is by means of the Training Colleges. Native inspectors and sub-inspectors of kuttabs are drawn from the Nasrieh Training College ; while attendance at the Training College for English-speaking natives opens the way to the headmasterships of Primary schools. We would particularly call attention to the greatly improved prospects of the headmasters and senior teachers in Primary schools.</p></div>

                    <p>The many alterations and improvements that have been carried out during the past few months at the above hospital, and which it was hoped would have been completed by the 1st December last, will not be finished for another month or so, the delay having been caused by the native workmen employed. The whole of the masonry work in connection with the second floor that has been added to the hospital is now finished, and the plasterers, painters, and carpenters are busy completing the remaining work, but it is not intended to open the new wards before the 1st April, so as to allow time for them to dry thoroughly before admitting patients. In the mean while the old 1st and 2nd class wards on the first floor, which had been closed for some months during the building operations, have been reopened to paying patients. The new lift will also be in operation by the latter date.</p>
                    <p>The additions to the building include fourteen rooms, which will be reserved exclusively in future for paying patients of European nationality, and the old wards will then be retained for natives. On the second storey there will be likewise a new special operating-room , fitted with all the latest improvements. This was needed in consequence of the great increase in the number of operations during the past few years.</p></div>

                    There was a large house at the Zizinia theatre last night for the third performance ot Giordano's new opera, “Siberia.” The audience, however, appeared, as on the previous occasions, to be affected by the coldness of the surroundings. The interpretation was good, especially as regards Signora Amelia Pinto in the role of Stephana and the baritone Nani as Gleby. The chorus was better than ever, the Siberian exiles’ chorus, in particular, being exceedingly well rendered. The orchestra was excellent.</p></div>

Signora Svicher again astonished us all by her wonderful vocalism. She seems to possess no less than three octaves in her voice, and every note is taken with ease and clearness : her singing was a marvel of technique and withal charming in tone. Signor Tomisani still appears to be suffering from a slight cold, but all through the 3rd act he was delightful. We would mention the others did it not seem invidious to single out anyone where all were so uniformly good, and, we may add, so highly appreciated by the audience.</p></div>

                    <p>Nous sommes heureux de donner aujourd’­hui à nos lecteurs les réfutations que le Cou- seil d’Administration de cette Compagnie op­pose contre les accusations portées contre elle.</p>
                        <p>Ou se rappelle que le Comité daus sa lettre reprochait h la Compagnie d’abuser de privilè- ges exorbitants et parmi ceux-ci, il citait le droit d’élever ou d'abaisser les pri* de transi ports,* de créer ou supprimer des tarifs d’abon­nement, de modifier les horaires, d’allonger ou de réduire la durée du trajet,de créer des gares oil bon lui semble, de fournir un matériel de qualité médiocre, d’augmenter ou réduire le nombre de voitures en servie^ de-faire servir la voie établie pour de lourdes locomotives 2 des voitures légères.</p>
                            <p>Tels sont les pouvoirs de la Compagnie que le Comité traitait d'exorbitants.</p>
                                <p>Le Conseil d’Administration fait tout d'abord observer qu'étant données les conditions usa elles qui régissent en tous pays les entreprises do transports, il n'en est pas une qui ne jouisse, —sous la seule réserve de maintenir ses tarifs en dessous des prix maxirna stipulés daus les actes de concessions,— du droit de régler tous les points énumérés ci-dessus par le Comité. Mais pour permettre à chacun de jugor en par­faite connaissance de cause l'exactitude des griefs allégués, U lès reprend un à un et les fait suivre,des réponses qu'ils comportent.</p>
                                    <p>1“ Modification des horaires. IA Compa­gnie a constamment augmenté le nombre de ses trains qui n'étaient que de 17 par jour eh 1880, et qui, par des augmentations succes­sives, avaient été porté A ,52 par jour eu 1303. Aujourd’hui, avec la transformation électrique, ce dernier chiffre a été sextuplé. Eu effet 1: nombre des trains a été do 300, en hiver, et do 400, pendant l’été, les départs se succédant eu hiver h des intervalles de 4 a 6 minutes, et eu été de 3 a 3 minutes.</p>
                                <p>2 Augmentation ou diminution du nombre de VOITURES en SERVICE. Toute entreprise de transport modifie le nombre de ses voitures selon les saisous avec les exigences du trafic, et il est bien naturel qu’il y eu ait davantage pen­dant la saison d’été que pendant celle d’hiver où le trafic est moins actif, il semble difficile de sou tenir que_ le chiltre de 300 trains par jour, représentant le mouvement de l’exploita­tion de la Compagnie eu hiver, soit une dimi­nution sur ce qu était le service avant la trans­formation électrique.</p>
                                <p>3“ Augmentation de la duree du trajej. Cette aliégutiun, déclare la Compagnie, est inexacte, comme toutes les autres. Le trajet d’Alexandrie à Sau-i3tefauo se faisait avec lés trains A vapeur, en uu peu moins d'une demi heure ; les voitures électriques le /ont dans le même temps, malgré l’augmentation du nombre des stations ou haïtes, créées ^iniquement pour satisfaire aux demaudes du public, lia Compagme a décidé d ailleurs pour gagner en­core plus de temps de séparer le service dça traius pour lea-statiousde l lbrahimieh jusqu’à Sidi-Uaber d'avec celui des stations de Kamieü; et daus ce but, elle compte mettre, des que les garages nécessaires pour les croisements des trams auront pu être construits, des voi­tures. spéciales pour I ibrahnnieh, celles de Ramleh no s'arrêtant plus a aucune des gares situées entre Alexandrie et Sidi-Uaber.</p>
                                <p>Création ou Suppression de Stations.
                                    La compagnie a constamment augmenté le nombre de ses gares ainsi que le montre le tableau suivant ;</p>
                                <p>11 y avait en 1835 ... 	 8	stations.
                                    do	1690 	 10	do
                                    do	1900 	 16	do
                                    do	1904 	 21	do</p>
                                <p>et l’ouverture do 3 autres stations est projetée pour 1905.</p>
                                <p>5* Materiel de Qualité Médiocre St Cahotement des voitures. La compagnie n’a rien épargué pour acquérir un matériel de choix et elle s'est adressée dans ce but A uue des premières maisons d’Angleterre “The British Electric Car C” Ld." de Londres qui a fourni le matériel de la “City X South London Tube Railway” et de diverses autres compagnies de tramways de la région de Londres.</p>
                                <p>Si, à l'usage on a constaté certaines imper­fections de détails, dont le public s’est plaint, telles que des glaces trop lour­des ot difficiles A manier, ainsi que le cahotement dû A des ressorts trop sen­sibles, la Compagnie s’est préoccupée d’y remétlier graduellement.</p>
                                <p>Emploi du la. Voie Fehreb Etablie pour Locomotives &amp; Wagons Lourds a des Voi­tures Legeres. 11 est difficile de s'arrêter A ce grief, car on ne voit pas comment une voie solidement construite avec des rails capables de supporter des locomotives serait impropre au roulement des voitures légères de tram­ways.</p>

                    <p>*******NEEDS TABLE********</p>
                    <p>Ce tableau montre que le trajet simple qui revenait en 1895 à 5 P.T. en 1ère Classe et a 3 P.T. en Sème Classe, àoondition qu’on prltdes billets d’aller et retour, ne coûte plus que 1 P.T.5 en 1ère et 0. P.T. 75 en 2e Classe, grâce aux carnets à prix réduits. La réduction totale est donc de 70% et elle est encore de 25%, si l’on oom-pare les prix actuels à ceux d’il y a un an.</p>
                    
                    <p>En cequi concerne les abonnements, le prix d’uue carte annuelle a été abaissé depuis 1875 de £17 à £9 1/2 pour la 1ère Classe et de 13$ à 5 7/ pour la 2e.</p>
                    
                    <p>De tout ce qui précède, la Compagnie croit avoir suffisamment établi combien sont peu fondées les accusations portées contre elle par le Comité de Ramhsh. Elle n’hésite cependant pas à reconnaître qu’une d’elles est exacte ; c’est celle relative à la suppression des abonnements effectuée le 31 Décembre dernier.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cette suppression qui d’ailleurs fut accompagnée d’une réduction de 14% du prix des carnets, n’a nullement été faite en vue d’une augmentation do tarif, et la Compagnie n’aurait jamais soDgé à y recourir si la grande majorité des abonnée n’avait manqué à leurs engagements. Eu effet, le nombre des abonnements avait augmenté dans drteKhs propor rions qu’il était devenu impossible d’exercer lo moindre contrôle, si les abonnés ne consentaient à montrer leur carte d’abonnement aux contrôleurs, comme cela se fait dans tous les pays.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ces cartes n’avaient d’ailleurs été délivrées par la Compagnie qu’à cette condition expresse, que chaque abonné en souscrivant avait pris l'engagement formel de respecter.</p>
                    
                    <p>En refusant sans motif admissible de produire leurs cartes, les abonnés ont éto'la cause indirecte de fraudes si nombreuses qu'auçuue Compagnie n’aurait pu les tolérer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nombrede personnes voyageaient sans billet, se ooutentaut de répondre “abonné” aux contrôleurs qui le leur demandaient et n’admettaient pas d’insistance, qu’elles considéraient comme un acte de méfiance ou même une insulte. Eu plusieurs occasions même les agent» de la Compagnie furent l’objet do voies de fait, et il en était résulté qu’ils n'ôsaient plus demander les billets, se bornant à recueillir seulement ceux que las voyageurs voulaient bien leur remettre spontanément.</p>
                    
                    <p>C'est pour mettre fin à un pareil état de choses que la Compagnie, usant de son droit, et après de nombreux avertissements adressés au public et des avis affichés dans les voitures se décida à supprimer les abonnements, cause première de ces fraudes, tout en réduisant eu même temps de 14% le prix des carnets.</p>
                    
                    <p>C’est cette mesure, dont on ne saurait pourtant pas contester la légitimité qui souleva les colères, aujourd'hui heureusement apaisées à la suite d’une entente interveuuo entre la Compagnie et les délégués des abonnés protestataires.</p>
                    
                    <p>Il leur a suffi, en effet, d'étudier la'question avec calme et impartialité pour reconnaître que les abonnements tels qu’ils existaient ne pouvaient pas être rétablis et qu’ils devaient être remplacés par des carnets personnels délivrés aux mêmes prix que las anciens abon-ments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Le règlement relatif à cos îjouveaux carnets personnels a déjà été publié.</p>
                    
                    <p>En donnant au Gouvernement toutes les explications qui précèdent, la Compagnie lui a également fait part de la décision qu’ello avait prise de raccorder sa ligne actuelle à oellé des tramways d’Alexandrie, afin de pouvoir transporter les • voyageurs de Ramleh jusqu'à la place des Consuls, sans transbordement ni augmentation de tarifs. La Compagnie espère réaliser oe projet, qui donnera de si grandes facilités au public, dès que 1a Municipalité aura approuvé le raccordement.</p></div><cb n="2"/>

                <head>A NEW CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.</head>
                <p>A quarter of a century ago Professor Navile deciphered lrom Egyptian papyri a mythological text which he entitled “Ihe Destruction of Mankind by the Gods.” The story was con­sidered by many to be the Nile valley counter­part ot the Babylonian and Noacbian deluge;, it being suituised that, as water was so scarce in, uml such a beneluctor to Egypt, any tradi Hun militating a juUgmeut upon mankind by means of lloeu UaU oeeu changed, as in this myth, into punishment under some other form.</p>
                <p>Pile same eminent scholar has now published , another •mythological story,' "A Mention ot a Flood in the 'Book ot the Dead," apparently showing that a remembraUQe ot the laud ol Egypt having been submerged was still pre­served at the dale ot committal to writing of the earlier chapter of the ltiiual for the Dead.
                    ' Tim rescensiou of the myth cos Lured to us by M. Navnle is at present only known to him ' lrom two copies of the Ritual, one in a papyrus at. Leyden and the other in the splendid papyrus ot Ani in the British Museum, it is much to be regretted that the first manuscript, which possessed the more elabo­rate versiou ol the two, is severely mutilated, whilst the” second edition (for the Am text is later,' is uot only shorter in character, bpV suddeuly terminates in aoout the middj/ot the narrative. This is because tlm scribe, finding the necessary space lor/its engross­ment had been curtailed uy vignettes embla­zoned upon the papyrus by un artist previous to the document being handed to him to till in the literary matter, cut this im­portant narrative short wueuouiy hall indited, Through arriving at a pictuie. lie gives thero- lore only 25 lines as against 47 in the Leyden text. There i» also some reason to think that,seeing his intticuit},he altered the columns i the manuscript he was copyiug, Jasrhaps , nutting one or two he thought less impor­tant,in order to insert others lor which he knew he would not oihci wise buve space. Tile vignettes unfortunately do uot reter to this chapter nut to the 125th. The collection, tiausJauon, and rendering at all intelligible ol tbe two docu- niem? must have been a work ot profound patience, and so much ol their contents slih remains obscure that we preler to postpone any commentary upon them until further copies are available. This will probably be soon, now that attemiou lui> been directed to them.</p>
                <p>The passage of tiHisi interest is the para grapn wtierem Tune says :—</p>
                <p>T am going-to detaee all that 1 have done ; this eartu will become water (or au ocean; through an inundation, as it was at the beginning.’
                    The word used for riood does uot denote its being produced by rain, or marine inundation, but is tbe word lrequeuiiy applied to the rising ot tbe Nile. The tnuiitifln therefore quite differs from the Hebrew (Semitic) idea ; and may have originated from a disastrous Nile overflow in prehistoric times.</p>
                <p>The statement by the \Wity that originally the earth was n watery mass, is fully iu accoru with the description given by the author ot “Hermes Trismegistus,’’ who ris supposed to have derived his love from Egyptian tradition : who tells us, as rendered in Partliey's Latin translation of the Greek that—“Eraut emui “ tenebue infinite iuabysso etaqrne etspintus “ tenuisiiitebectuahs,potentiadiviuaexistenua  it, chad. Exiit lux saucta et concreta sunt “ ah areua elemeuta ex humida substantia, et “ dii omues distribaunt aliquid uatura semi- .	“ nalis.”</p></div>

                        <p>mercenaries imported with other Greek and Macedonian warriors by Ptolemy Eoergetes II. who, as described by Justin, wh :n he had lost the regard of all his subjects by his cruelties, called to him crowds of strangers. This happened about B.G. 146 and the Memphis inscription is supposed to be .lated some 20 years or more later, because | several of these owners of such foreign names have the names of their sous who have been given Greek names associated with those of theirparenta. The country, or district, from which these veterans using the word Koe in their titles emanated was thuught to be Idumea by some scholars who have noticed M. Miller’s edition of the inscription ; but now clear light has illuminated the subject by means of a dis­covery in Palestine.</p>
                        <p>There, at Marissa, in Samaria, a necropolis has been found which contains quite -a col­lection offunerary inscriptions and among them are numerous specimens of names “formulated in Kos” such as Kosuatanos, Kosbanos aud Kosakos. Now these are Iduiuean, or Edomite, dwellers in this part of Syria (or Palestine) and their names arc Compounds of their great deity Kos; their Kosuatanos being anlduinean name meaning “Kos has given." The husband of Sa- lome,Herod’ssister,wasKostobftras,an Iduiuean,
                            and Josephus tells us his ancestor had been priest of their deity,'Koze or Kos. This Kos is tho Arabic Kais in such names as Abd-el- Kais: the Edomite kaus, in the name of their King Kaus-gabri, and Kaus Malak mentioned in Assyrian annals, the Arabic God Kozah, or Kuzah, worshipped at Mecca and Zeus Kazios (Arabic Abd Kusai) are all connected with this ddity Kos, so is Barkos of the Old Testament, meaning “son of Kos.”</p>
                        <p>The interesting point.liowever.to students ot Egyptian history, is tlntt among many other mercenaries, or settlers, introduced into the Nile valley by the Ptolemies were a number of Id uni cans, some of whom the Memphis inscrip­tion proves resided in or near that city.
                            ^l'he long Aramaic papyrus of Persian times at Strasbourg and the fragmentary ones that hafe been edited by Mr. Stanley A. Cook and Clermont Ganneau are likely to be sur­passed in interest by the Aramaic documents obtained by Mr. Mond last winter and which are ni the hands of Mr. Cowley of Oxford. Meanwhile Professor Sayce has published some Aramaic inscriptions from Egypt: one "of which, coming from a quarry near Tourah, important for the history of Cairo,for it carries backward the application of the name of Babylon to Old Cairo to pre-Christian, ahd probably to the Persian, period. It ts the record of one “Phuti, son of Shaman the Babylonian.” An Aramaic papyrus gives the name Oozri connected with the iduiuean Kos of the previous note.</p>

The “Sealark" has been rather unlucky, as another deatnof one of the crew took place on Christ­mas Eve. The deoeased was buried in the oemetery with military honours, the firing party being furnished by the 3rd Egyptian Battalion. The funeral service was read by Mr. Kerry, actiog Moudir of Suakin.
