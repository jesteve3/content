                <div type="item"><head>LORD ROBERTS ON THE ARMY.</head>
                    <p>What “Bobs” has to say about the Army is what the Army and the nation want to hear. And Lord Roberts says his say to the extent of five-and-twenty pages in the current number of the 
                        Nineteenth Century. His article is large­ly historical, since his object is to draw a com­parison between the Army "as it was and as it is." All that he has to say on this side of the question 
                        is deeply interesting. In his own person he has seen the new grafted on the old. He has commanded the old Army in the field and led it to victory. He has also at an ad- vanoed age and bowed by 
                        personal trouble with astonishing vigor commanded and led to victory the largest army that we have ever put into the field, fighting under conditions as far removed from those under which Lord 
                        Roberts first saw service as is the khaki uniform from the bright coatees and cumbrous stocks in which the Peninsular campaigns were fought Lord Roberts's claims to reverence, respect and 
                        admiration rest on a sure basis of experience and devotion to the highest sense of duty.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is on his advice that interest will be fixed. The historical comparison is extremely interesting, and it leads to the reasoned optimism of a great soldier. In 1854 the British Army, at 
                        home and abroad, totalled 189,980 men, with 120 field guns. There was no Reserve and no Volunteer Force. With die Militia and Yeomanry, we had at the most 200,000 men. These men were 
                        incessantly drilled, but badly trained ; com­missions were purchased by officers whose education and intelligence were in inverse ratio to their gallantry.; the whole force was armed with 
                        inferior weapons and the men were not taught to shoot. In its day that little British Army went far and did wonders. But those were the days of point-blank range and close forma­tion. Since 
                        then by degrees we have adapt­ed our forces and our weapons to the changed conditions brought about by the scientific improvement of arms and ammunition and we have always managed to “muddle 
                        through.’’ It is not hard to understand that Lord Roberts, who knew the old Army, and who has known the new, in barracks, on pa­rade, and in action, should be something of an optimist, or that, 
                        seeing very clearly how much still remains to be done and the way in which progress should be attempted, he should give his advice with an apparent belief that advice may be followed before it 
                        is too late.</p>
                    <p>
                        But the root of the matter lies rather in the spirit than the letter, It is the spirit alone
                        that can revivify, and to all appearances our War Office is still imbued with the spirit that has done its best to kill the Army and the Empire. There has been a deal of fiddling with Army 
                        Corps and Districts and territorial designations and buttons and overcoats and the minutiae of drill. But the Army is as in­sufficient and inefficient as it was before the South African War 
                        showed us terrible things.
                        If we desired an illustration of the permanence of bad tradition (fortunately good tradition, courage and tenacity, and self-confidence, is equally permanent in the British Army), we could hot 
                        have a better one than Lord Ro­berts' story of how after adopting the Armstrong gun, our first breechloader, in 1858, we re­turned six years later to muzzle-loaders for our artillery. This 
                        brilliant notion can only have emanated from the same source as the amazing apathy which left the British Army in 1904 without the essential supply of quickfiring field- guns which had been 
                        tested, approved, and promised a year previously. Obviously we must slay this demon of incompetence in organisation before we can turn with much hope of their application to the reforms 
                        suggested by Lord Roberts</p>
                    <p>
                        It is not, however, too much to hope that even our troglodyte authorities will pay the compliment of attention to these suggestions. Lord Roberts urges the importance of the Cavalry arm. We 
                        must add largely to the numbers of our cavalry and the officers must be much more highly trained. To effect this, without undue interference with the polo and hunting which are “in moderation’’ 
                        so valuable a training for a cavalry officer, they must be better paid. If we want the -best we must pay for the best and make the service attractive to those whose abilities are good enough to 
                        ensure success in other pro­fessions. We must also have a very large body of Mounted infantry, not lesfthan ooc- fourth of the Infantry establishment. Than sinoe in modern warfare the ooutrol 
                        and guidance in aotion must pass to oompany commanders and aeotion leaden it is "es­sential that their intelligence, self-reliance, and power of leading should be on a proportionately higher 
                        level." Volleys being things of the past and so much depend­ing on accuracy of sum and fire discipline, “special attention should be paid to individual care and ooutrol of ammunition." The 
                        neces­sity for higher training aud for the servioee of men as officers and non-commissioued officers, whose intelligence and keeaness is beyond question, is further emphasised by Lord Ro­
                        berts’s oonviction that in the future most operations, indudiug the final attack, most,be carried out uuder cover of darkness, a lesson that is further enforced by the experiences of the 
                        Russo-Japanese campaign. “A terrible lesson,” says Lord Roberts with grim warning, “awaits the nation whose soldiers find them­selves opposed to equally brave but better trained opponents on 
                        tbe field of battle."</p>
                    <p>We have only to look to the blood-stained plains of Manchuria to take the lesson to heart. With the great commander's views on the neoeeeity of some lorm of national servioe we are in 
                        sympathy. Lord Roberts holds no brief for oonacnption. He prefers the voluntary soldier, but he feels, that all classes “must be prepared to undergo suoh a modicum of train­ing as will make 
                        themjntelul as soldiere” in time of need. Surely uis object and tbe physical regeneration of the nation oould be achieved by the enoouragement end ex ten sion of the association whioh interests 
                        itself ic fostering the military training ot our youth between the ages of twelve and sixteen, or thereabouts. It wonld be the nation’* surest defence against the terrors of con soription. If 
                        Lord Roberta can indace thi authorities to see to this aud to making the service attractive and possible for tb right stamp of man, be may render to tb Army, which he no longer commands, 
                        servioe almost as great as those services in the field which have earned him his sure place in th ranks of the world’s great soldiers.</p></div>

                        <p>A sanguinary dispute occurred here between the Latin and Greek clergy
                            whilst the latter were performing the Christmas midnight mass.
                                <persName>The Patriarch</persName> was officiating at
                                <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>. The Latins were apparently the
                            aggressors, for when the Greek ecclesiastics in vestments were issuing
                            from the northern entrance of the Giotto of the Nativity, the Franciscan
                            monks barred their way and a collision ensued, with the result that one
                            Franciscan was seriously wounded and the Patriarch’s janissary slightly
                            so. The <persName>Governor of Jerusalem</persName> went to the Grotto.
                            Notwithstanding their exclusive ownership of the eastern entrance, the
                            Greeks were ultimately allowed to pass through the northern door, hence
                            the jealousy. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The P. 0. SB. “Mongolia" reached <placeName>Port Said</placeName> on Thursday
                        afternoon, and after taking in 1,200 mail bags and 800 tons of ooal, left
                        for Suez, from which port she sailed on Friday evening. The voyage from
                        England was full of disagreeable incidents. She was detained for two days at
                            <placeName>Tilbury</placeName> in the blackest of fogs, which rendered
                        it impossible for the passengers to go ashore, but when the fog lifted for a
                        few hours on Christmas Day she lost no time in starting. The overland
                        passengers reached <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> on Friday, December 30,
                        to be told that the “Mongolia” had only just left
                            <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>, and they must stay at a hotel at the
                        company's expense. When the steamer arrived on the following day, so strong
                        a mistral was blowing from the N. N. W. that she could neither get into
                        dock, nor could a tug proceed to her. She therefore took up a position of
                        safety under the hills to the west of the town, where she was shortly joined
                        by a dozen other steamers which were unable to make the port. On New Year’s
                        Day the French agent of the P. and 0. Company made some in adequate
                        arrangements by which some 200 passengers succeeded in boarding the steamer
                        with their luggage. The sea was then less rough because the wind had dropped
                        somewhat bat it was so cold that no one was surprised to see snow falling.
                        The bad weather and numerous snow storms lasted until the Straits of Messina
                        had been passed, after which the weather became fairly good, with the
                        exception of occasional showers of hail and rain. The ship travelled well in
                        spite of the rough sea, and averaged from 16 .to 17 miles an hour every day.
                        Nearly 100 passengers were booked for Cairo, including <persName>Sir

                            che le differenze che sorgono tra il pubblieo ed una pubblica
                            amministrazione devono essere solo risolti civilmente e non all’ombra
                            della polizia, che e spauracchio per i malfattori e non per gente onesta
                            quale noi siamo. Signori ! noi siamo riusciti a fare mantenere dalla
                            compagnia i prezzi di abbonamento di prima, solo quest’ultima ha
                            domandato delle limitazione. L’amministrazione fara degli abbonamenti
                            trimestrali, - semistrali ed annuali e cio nel modo seguente: Per un
                            trimestre dara tre carnets che saranno valevoli per i tre mesi e alia
                            scadenzadi questi i biglietti rimaneuti non avranno piu alcun valore.
                            Ogni carnet avra 120 biglietti, cioe 4 ogni giorno. Per un semestre dara
                            6 carnett } nella stessa proporzione del trimestre. Per un anno dark 12
                            carnets nella proporzione come sopra. E bene inteso che questi carnett
                            sono personali esclusivamente. Per mezzo della nostra energica
                            abnegazione i carnets oggi essistenti resteranno allo stesso | prezzo di
                            P.T.. 77 per ogni carnets di 50 , biglietti di prima classe e di P.T. 37
                            1/2 per , ogni carnet di 50 biglietti di terza classe. I : mezzi
                            biglietti saranno calcolati nella medesima proporzione. Noi abbiamo
                            insistito presso S.E. Bogos Pacha Nubar perche alla limitazione dei
                            viaggi sia dato un compenso per i viaggi intermediari ed a tale uopo
                            domandammo 10 biglietti ogni mese al di fuori di quelli compresi in ogni
                            carnet Insistemmo pure fare aumentare di 4 bigliet-ti quei carnets che
                            dovranno servire per i mesi di 81 giorni e cio per eliminare qualsiase
                            lesione d’interesse a torto degli abbonati Per queste nostre domande e
                            stato risposto al di la j delle nostre aspettative. S.E Baghos Nubar
                            Pacha ha aqcordato 400 biglietti per ogni trimestre cio epiu di 138
                            biglietti ogni mese invece di 120 che essi ci accordavano. Per tale
                            operato vi propongo di applaudire al consiglio di Amministrazione della
                            Ramleh ed a S.E. Boghos Nubar Pacha. Come vedete in poche ore noi siamo

                        <head>THE OPPOSITION.</head>
                        <p>The president’s speech was followed by a dis-course from <persName>M.
                                Zenie</persName>, another member of the Ramleh Delegation who spoke
                            in French and Arabic. He dwelt on the great debt whioh all the
                            Ramlehites were under to the president, owing to whose energy,
                            pertinacity, and diplo macy the population of Ramleh had been freed from
                            the yoke which the, directors of -the Railway Company had vainly
                            endeavoured to place on them. While this speech was proceed-ing it
                            became clear that there was a strong opposition to the amicable
                            settlement as proposed by the president. But by the explanation which
                                <persName>Mr. Quintavalle</persName> addressed to the dissen-tients,
                            it was manifest that this opposition was due to failure to grasp the
                            tenour of the president’s speech. One member of the audience reproached
                            the meeting with the charge that all they really wanted was to travel
                            free. This opprobrious imputation was severely resented by the
                            Ramlehites. Another incident occurred when two engineers got up and
                            addressed the meeting on the subject of a motor service. When these
                            gentlemen began to speak, the delegatee withdrew, as the subject under
                            dis-cussion was not on the order of the day moreover the president had-
                            refused to assent to these gentlemen, Messrs. Arcondoulis and Movesse,
                            making any 'remarks. The delegates and the Ramlehites then marched to
                            the residences of <persName>Mr. Alderson</persName> and. <persName>M.
                                Jacot de Combes</persName>, whom they serenaded. ' The delegates
                            have been entrusted with a mandate to enter into negotiations with the
                            company in order to settle the position of the population of

                        <p>We have received the following notice from the Alexandria and'Ramleh
                            Railway Com-pany :--- “The Board of Directors, taking into consideration
                            that the suppression of season tickets or “abonnements,” was not decided
                            on with the object of increasing the tariff but only with the intention
                            of putting an cud to abuses, which had taken such proportions as to be
                            very prejudicial to the company’s interests, and being desirous of
                            conciliating, as much as possible, these interests with those of the
                            inhabitants of Ramleh, the Board has decided to replace the old season
                            tickets by books of tickets, which will be offered for sale, on and
                            after the 1st April next. " These books will be strictly personal, the
                            owner’s photograph will be attached to them, and they will contain a
                            number of tickets calculated on the basis of 400 journeys per quarter,
                            or three months. "There will be separate books for three, six, and
                            twelve months, containing 400; 800, or 1,600 tickets, at the prices of
                            £3, £5 1/2 and £ 9 1/2 respectively, for the first class and £1.750,
                            £3.250, and £5.700 for the second class. “These books oft tickets will
                            be valid for three months, from the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July,
                            and 1st October of each year. "The tickets contained in these books will
                            only be valid when they are detached by the company's agents and used
                            during the quarter, half-year, or year to which they refer.
                            'Provisionally, and up to the time of the employment of the above
                            mentioned personal books of tickets, the former season-ticket holders,
                            whose tickets have now expired, will be able to receive for the first
                            quarter, in ordinary ticket books, a number of tickets calculated on the
                            basis of 400 tickets per quarter, at the price of £3 per 400 first-class
                            and £1.750 second-class tickets, from the day following the expiration
                            of each season ticket, until the 31st March next. “Independently of the
                            new books of personal tickets, the discount allowed from the first
                            January last, on ordinary books of 50 tickets, will be maintained, their
                            price remains fixed at P.T. 75 for 1st class and P.T. 35 1/2 for 2nd

                <head type="sub">CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES.</head>
                <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                <p>Suakin, December 30.</p>
                <p>H.M.S. “Sealark,” survey ship, returned here from Sheikh Barghout on the 23rd inst. At daybreak on the 24th the Commander's valet was suddenly taken ill, and expired very shortly after. The funeral procession took place at 2.30 p.m. the same day. All the officers and crew followed the mortal remains of the deceased in boats to the Christian cemetery on Quarantine Island. The burial service was read by the Commander and the usual naval honors were paid  to the deceased at the grave.</p>
                <p>The same evening (Christmas Eve) a grand concert was given by the Suakin Cosmopolitan Orchestra, under the directorship of Mr. Henry Moss, the popular Assistant Commandant Suakin Police. The orchestra is composed of a number of Sudan Government employes and is international. The function was a thorough and well deserved success, and the performance reflected the greatest credit on Mr. Muss. The Town Hall, where the concert was held, was tastefully decorated with flags and banners, kindly lent for the occasion by H.M.S. “Sealark” and the Sudan Government steamer “Mukhbir.” The progamma opened by the orchestra playing the March '‘Sardinia.” The Arabic song “Bi Cita Real Yabba Gows Ni,” by El Sayid el Hassan, was heartily encored, especially by the Egyptians. Mr. Kirby and Sig. Ura were successful in their violin duet and were encored several times. Mrs. Purvis elicited great praise by her charming rendering of the pianotorte solo, “Preghiera del Mose.” The orchestra played once more,this time "The English Gentleman," and was encored a second time. Corporal George, K.E., gave a most amusing recitation entitled “British Pluck,” by Kipling. Mr. Razzle, in his banjo solo, was a great success. Commander Somerville, R.N., of H.M.S. “Sealark,” at the request of the guests, sang an Irish comic song, and was encored so heartily that he had to give another. A. B. Myers, R.N., of H.M.S. "Sealark,” sang very well, and was encored by his mates to such an extent that he, too, had to give another song. The Khedivial Anthem was then played by the orchestra, and the proceedings ended with “God Save the King.”</p>
                <p>A well-stocked buffet was furnished for the guests by the Suakin Mondirieh and Jack Jar did ample justice to the good things that were provided for him. I was glad to see Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Controller of Sudan Ports, on his feet again and entertaining his sailor friends. He was greatly cheered and several Britishers carried him around the hall shoulder-high singing "He's a jolly good fellow.”</p>
                <p>Among the guests were : Mr. Kerr, Acting Moudir of Suakin, Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Controller Sudan Ports, Bimbashi Spencer, Inspector, Suakin Moudirieh, Bimbashi Ensor, Principle Medical Officer, Suakin Moudirieh, Commander Somerville, R.N., and all the officers of H.M.S. “Sealark,” Mr. Mackenzie, Superintendents Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, Suakin, and several others.</p>
                <p>H.M.S. “Sealark" went to sea again on the 26th for surveying purposes.</p>
                <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, Director, Sudan Railways, went up as far as Railhead on the morning of the 23th inst. by a special train on inspection, returning to Suakin the same evening.</p>
                <p>The Khedivial mail steamer “Mehallah”
                    arrived here from Suet on the 28th inst, having on board Mr. C. M. Hickley, who has been acting Sudan Agent at Alexandria and who will now resume his duties with the Suakin-Atbara Bailway.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><p>“The Magazine of Commerce.”—This excellent monthly publication is now in its third year of publication, and its success shows that it has met a great want on the part of the British manufacturer and merchant. As a medium for the dissemination of knowledge of centre British inventions to our colonial business houses, it should command an increased circulation—especially in these days of foreign enterprise. The standard of literary merit is a high one, the magazine is illustrated throughout, and in the number for December, 1904, will be found an interesting sketch of Lord Ribblesdale’s career, an excellent portrait of his lordship forming the frontispiece of this issue. The Magazine of Commerce is published at 155 and 156, Cheapside, London.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>ACCESSION DAY.</head>
                <head type="sub">RECEPTION AND REVIEW.</head>
                <p>Yesterday’s Khedivial reception was largely attended, and from an early hour numbers visitors made their way to Abdeen Palace. The Diplomatic Agents and Consuls, the Minister and the Advisers, the heads of department, and many of the chief officers of the British Army of Occupation attended the reception, with a multitude of officials and notables. While it was in progess, many tourists and sight seers paid visits to Abdeen-square to watch the arrival of those who attended the reception, and to make guesses, sometimes very mistaken ones, at their identity.</p>
                <p>Cairo was favored with bright, if cool, weather. The streets, in consequence of the general holiday, were crowded, and the square before the Khedivial Opera House, the neighbourhood of Abdeen, and the Esbekieh Gardens were gaily decorated.</p>
                <p>The afternoon's review was a remarkably fine sight The appearance and marching of the troops was very good, and the cavalry, both when trotting and cantering past, went by splendidly, better even than last year. The galloping Maxims caused a good deal of interest to an enormous concourse.</p>
                <p>The management of the crowd—there must have been more than 15,000 persons round the parade-ground—reflects great credit on the police, and that too though there was not room in the carriage enclosure for all the carriages whose occupants had tickets, and the standing room was decidedly limited. The police, however, did well—there was no unnecessary  shooting, and the crowd, if packed pretty tightly, were as good-humoured as an Egyptian crowd can be.</p>
                <p>The order of the review was as follows:—</p>
                <p>Cavalry in line, artillery in line at half intervals.</p>
                <p>lnfantry in quarter-column of half-battalions at Iff; paces interval.</p>
                <p>After the infantry had passed and repassed the cavalry rode by at the trot and then at a canter. The Khedive took the salute from beside the standard. His Highness looked very well and was mounted on a very fine Arab. The principal officers of the staff and the bodyguard squadron were drawn up behind him. After the cavalry had cantered past, Lewa Lord Edward Cecil Pasha rode to the troops, followed by the officers of the Staff, and ordered the Khedivial salute, three times repeated by the troops and accompanied by the Khedivial Hymn. The Khedive then gave leave to dismiss the troops, and the review ended.</p>
                <p>Cairo was brilliantly decorated last night, the streets were full, and the xxx proceeded merrily in the Esbekieh Gardens. The decorations were illuminated. A fine pillarlike erection had been got into place near the statue of Ibrahim Pasha and was decorated with red and green lamps and, on the summit, with the crescent and star in white lights. Musicians, conjurors, sweetmeat-sellers, etc., swarmed and by 9 p.m. it was quite clear that Cairo — native Cairo at least—was going to amuse itself till early morning.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>MALTA.</head>
                <p>The report of Governor Sir C. M. Clarke on the affairs of the Colony of Malta during 1903-4 has been published in the annual series of Colonial Reports (No. 439, Cd. 2238-16). The revenue for the year 1903-4, exclusive of the value of stores issued, was £464,391, and the expenditure £410,887. The excess of revenue over expenditure for the year was, therefore, £53,704. Including £142, the value of stores issued during the year, and £19,416, the surplus brought forward from 1902-3, the net surplus standing to the credit of the Government at the dose of the financial year was £73,262. The total value of dutiable goods imported in 1903-4 was £7,158,079, showing an increase of £595,281 over the value of the imports in the preceding year. The increase is almost entirely found under wheat, which shows an advance of £579,899. Of the total imports, £1,318,430 is the value of goods landed for local consumption, against £1,361,650 in 1902-3; and £5,839,649 is the value of dutiable goods re-exported in the same bottoms, as against £5,301,148 in the previous year. The value of the dutiable goods exported in 1903 4, exclusive of local produce,was £6,145,883, as against £5,849,576 in 1902-3. This represents an increase of £796,307. The value of whole cargoes which were carried in the same bottoms were £6,022,107, and that of the portions of cargoes which were landed and reexported was £123,776. The number of British ships which entered the ports of Malta in 1903-4 was 1,335, as against 1,837 in the previous year, and their tonnage was 2,464,464, as against 2,390,761—a decrease of two ships and an increase of 73,703 tons. Foreign steamships showed a total of 1,079, with a tonnage of 1,062,420, as against 1,030, with a tonnage of 1,069,299 in 1902-3, an increase of 49 in ships, with a decrease of 6,979. The principal event of 1903 was the visit of his Majesty King Edward VII., who arrived on April 16 on board the Royal yacht Victoria and Albert and remained in Malta till the morning of the 20th. This was the first occasion on which Malta had been honored by a visit from the reigning Sovereign, and the King received a loyal and enthusiastic welcome from all classes. The report contains much information as to finance, trade, agriculture, legislation, education, and other matters.</p></div>

                <p>From letters which have been received at Cairo it seems that Sir Wm. Willcocks was greatly struck by the possibilities of Koweit. He says it is capable of making a splendid harbour and should be the future Alexandria of that country. He is delighted with the climate, and the comparative nearness to the Himalayas make work there seem much more feasible. Of course. he is full of the grandeur of the Euphrates, and writing to a correspondent from Basra, Sir William says:— The Euphrates is a splendid river here, as wide as the Nile at Cairo and half as deep, with millions of date palms on every side. I hope the country will turn out propitious when I find myself at Bagdad, where I hope to be on the 23rd orv24th (December). I am in Sindbad the Sailor’s home. He would have made loss voyages if he had been cursed with quarantines in his day.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>EGYPTOLOGICAL RESEARCH.</head>
                <p>During the past year a strong local committee of Liverpool men in connection with the University of Liverpool has been formed to promote the study of archaeology, and has been strengthened by such well-known names in this connexion as those of Dr. Arthur Evans, Mr. Hilton Price, Prof. Ridgeway, and Prof. Boyd Dawkins. They have taken premises in Bedford-street, where they have established, in addition to a small but fairly complete library, a museum of Egyptian antiquities, presented for the most part by the local patrons of Egyptian exploration, such as Sir John Brunner, Mr. William Johnston, and Mr. John Rankin. Many of these were discovered by Mr. John Garstang, the newly appointed Lecturer in Archaeology, and there are to be found here the duplicate ivory tablet of Aha, found by him at Negadah last year, many of the other objects exhibited by him at the Society of Antiquaries in the summer, and an entirely representative collection from Beni Hassan and elsewhere. A reception held in this museum on Saturday week by Lady Alice Stanley fitly inaugurated the Institute, of which the Princess Henry of Battenberg is the patron ; and the course of lectures announced, which include the archaeology of Greece and Western Asia, as well as that of Egypt, leave nothing to be desired. The Institute has also arranged to conduct excavations on its own account at Edfu and Esneh during the forthcoming season.</p></div>

But I think that intending subscribers, before forwarding their donations, are entitled to be informed whether or not it is the fact that:—</p>
                    <p>(а)	The hospital is used for maternity
                        cases</p>
                    <p>(b)	Soldiers' wives, or rather, the wives of soldiers belonging to the Army of Occupation, are received therein for their confinement gratuitously</p>
                    <p>(e) Fifteen out of the twenty-two beds, which is all the hospital contains, were occupied during the past year at one and the same period by cases of the above description</p>
                    <p>I think, moreover, it ought to be stated whether, assuming the above questions are answered in the affirmative, it was the intention of the founders of this hospital that it should be used for lying-in purposes  and, furthermore, whether the executive committee intend to so use it henceforth.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>CHARITY ORGANISATION SOCIETY.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—Among the short paragraphs inserted above the initials “T. A.” under the heading “Under the Mosquito Net” in your issue of the 31st December last, the writer, in referring to “ cases of real destitution worthy o fhelp,” incidentally alludes in anything but complimentary terms to the Charity Organisation Society, which he (or she) most unfairly denominates that “Sham of Shams."</p>
                    <p>As an old subscriber to the abused society and a thorough believer, from knowledge, the good which for years past has resulted day by day from the fulfilment of the duties which the society in question has undertaken to perform, I cannot but think that “T. A" must have written his condemnation with but scant knowledge of facts, and perhaps will not object to my attempting to set him right and to my trying to prevent the injury which such comments might, if uncontradicted, inflict on a most deserving institution.</p>
                    <p>The Charity Organisation Society was not instituted for the administration of charitable funds, but for the guidance and assistance of the charitably disposed who might desire that their contributions to the aid of their less fortunate fellow-creatures should not pass into unworthy channels or assist in pauperising, instead of helping, those who might be willing although temporarily unable to support themselves and those dependent upon them.</p>
                    <p>From my own personal knowledge the secretary would be the last person to “turn a deaf oar” to any case of real distress which might come before him. It is not however part of the duty of this particular society to divert the proper employment of its funds to “seeking out" cases of distress, or to put itself into competition with other institutions, whether charitable or rate-aided, whose functions are different from its own, and which may be much better qualified to perform the work to which your correspondent refers.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
                    <p>A. C. C.</p>
