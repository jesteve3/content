Bousquet received his guests with his usual warmth.</p><p>Many of the larger buildings in the princi- pal streets of Cairo were decorated with tricolour flags, and Sharia Kamel in particular presented a very gay appearance. Many of the French establishments were illuminated after sunset, and the Esbekieh Gardens, which were the scene of the principal festivities, were most effectively decorated; and the numerous Chinese lanterns, gas jets, and coloured electric globes, which had been arranged in most artistic designs, gave a most picturesque and fairy-like look to the gardens.</p><p>The gates opened at 9 p.m. and large crowds at once streamed in. M. Bonsquet was greeted on his arrival by the strains of the “Marseillaise,” played by the two military bands and a string band which were in attendance. The French anthem was repeated on the arrival of M. Bonin, who is replacing M. de la Boulinière in Cairo, and arrived at 9.30 p.m., followed by Mr. F. W. Machell, who had been deputed to represent H.B.M.’s Agency, and was greeted by the British national anthem.</p><p>The principal attractions of the evening were supplied by the bands of the Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry, who played alternately, by the variety entertainment of the fall troupe of the Nouveautés music hall, and by a pyrotechnic display. The fireworks were unfortunately somewhat affected by the damp, and the set-pieces were to a great extent hid by clouds of smoke. The rockets, Roman candles, etc., were far more successful.

British makers have cause to be thankful for this, as the bulk of the orders are now being placed in their hands. This policy is not merely confined to the Government lines, but private companies are following suit.</p><p>A case in point, and one which serves to show also how great and growing an industry is scientific farming in the land of the Pharaohs, is afforded by the eight special bogie wagons ordered from the Leeds Forge Co. by the Société des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d’Egypte for one of their private lines. These wagons have been designed wholly and solely for the purpose of transporting steam ploughing engines and their tackle from one district to another to enable them to enlarge their field of operations.</p><p>Each wagon is provided at one end with a ramp, hinged to the headstock of the underframe, which can be lowered on to the rails, and a hand-winch at the other end, to enable the ploughing engine to be hauled on to the wagon or removed therefrom. When the wagons are running the ramp is lifted to a vertical position, and there secured by stays. The buffers on the ramp end of the underframe are hinged at the bottom, so that by taking a cotter out of the top they will drop out of the way of the ramp. Struts are also placed under this end of the wagon, which require to be adjusted slightly above the rail level to take a portion of the weight while the engine is over the same, thus preventing the underframe being strained through the whole of the load being carried by one bogie. It is not necessary, however, to use these struts when the plough or cultivator is being placed on the wagon, as these machines are, of course, considerably lighter than the engine. The struts can be placed out of the way on a hook under the headstock when the wagon is running. The ramp is raised and lowered by passing the rope from the winch through a snatch-block, which is attached to the underframe and then over struts on the ramp. The struts can be lowered to the level of the floor out of the way when the engine is being hauled up the ramp.</p><p>When power is required for lifting the engine, the same snatch-block is used. The rope is attached to the engine, passed through the block and back to a hook under the winch. The winch is designed to give a pull of three tons from the barrel when working in double purchase—i. e., a total pull of six tons is available when using the snatoh-blook on the engine for hauling the latter on to the wagon. The weight of the ploughing engine is twenty- two tons.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.14"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.14. </span><span class="head">STEAMER MOVEMENTS.</span></h3><p>The Ellerman S.S. “Bulgarian” sailed hence for Liverpool on Thursday with a general cargo, including 4,103 bales cotton.</p><p>The Ellerman S.S.

Though many of the newspapers of Egypt disagreed with his views, yet all lament his loss, which affects not Egypt only but the whole of Islam.......Before he breathed his last the Sheikh uttered the following verses:</p><p>"I care not what has been said of Mohamed Abdou by those who gather together and exult over his death.</p><p>"But our Faith I have endeavoured to reform.</p><p>“Fearing its ruin by those who wear turbans.</p><p>“Every living being has hopes that he longs to accomplish.</p><p>“If I die all my hopes will come to naught</p><p>"O God, if Thou wilt, heal me or take me to the other world.</p><p>“Bless the world of Islam and grant it good guidance, an enlightened guide, the path of righteousness in the darkness of night”</p><p>(“Al Mokattam.”)</p><p>Our relations with the Grand Mufti, Shaikh Mohamed Abdou, were intimate and friendly before the rising led by Arabi Pasha, and our friendship was renewed during the residence of the exiled Sheikh in Syria. Our friendship was no mere matter of intimacy, but was based upon the harmony of our principles on all matters connected with the Welfare of Egypt We both realised the inconvenience arising from the attitude of those who opposed progress with no arguments but those of ignoranoe.......Egypt has sustained a loss which will be hard to remedy, a loss whose results God only can know. The most enlightened and advanced man in Egypt, his teaching was a light to the minds of the students and Ulema and to all who longed for something beyond the old theories, which did not satisfy the needs of the modern social system....Again, the deceased was most anxious to see the results of his work, and was a really great reformer and seeker after Egypt’s welfare. As a teacher and expounder of religious theory to the students of Al Azhar, as an enlightened author, as manager of ancient schools and administrator of numerous benevolent societies, he was known to all. His reforming influence was made manifest in the Legislative Council, while he was ever ready to defend his faith against insult. He was constantly employed on charitable committees formed to assist the victims of fire or other misfortunes. He always endeavoured to prevent any cause of hostility between Egyptians and foreigners.........and before the era of legality he did not fear the despotism of the Government, but his defence of liberty of action and thought brought him trouble throughout his life.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.16"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.16. </span><span class="head">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.</span></h3><p>We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed by our correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to permit - within certain necessary limits - free discussion. </p><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.16_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">3.16.1. </span><span class="head">THE LATE GRAND MUFTI.</span></h4><p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p><p>Dear Editor,—The death of the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, is a great loss not only to Egypt but to every Mohamedan country. It was the privilege of the writer to spend some days with him before he went to Alexandria, and to love him as a son loves his father. In this age of the world civilisation, although still very faulty, teaches us religious toleration. The Moslems need to learn this lesson as well as the Christians. It is very difficult, but we know the grand old Sheikh had learned it well and was not afraid to teach it against most fanatic opposition. It is a most worthy object, especially for us young men, to ever keep alive the memory of this gentle, loving, wise man, who was forced to lay down his work before he wished—and who was so active in his love for God and Egypt to the very last.

Surely some system may be devised to prevent the overcrowding of the San Stefano cars. Could it not be arranged that they stop only at the small stations, i.e., Carlton, Sporting Club, etc., and pass the larger stations; as it seems to me the latter are very efficiently attended to by the Palais cars. It is no uncommon sight to see the San Stefano cars absolutely filled, and people hanging to the outside, while a Palais car comes along with plenty of room. Doubtless this is well known to the officials of the line, but for some inscrutable reason it is allowed to go on. After all, it is only in keeping with the terminus at Alexandria, where passengers have to stand in the sun and dust, in the dustiest corner of the city, while waiting for a car ; and this has to be borne from a company that, I am informed, pays a dividend of 20 % - I am, etc.</p><div class="byline">Nemo.</div></div></div></div><div class="page" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span></h2><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.1. </span><span class="head">EGYPTIAN LAND AND GENERAL TRUST. SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMPANY</span></h3><p>The statutory meeting of the Egyptian Land and General Trust Company, Limited, was held in London on the 6th inst, at Winchester House, Old Broad Street, Sir Willing F. Haynes Smith, K.C.M.G., LL.D. (chairman of the company), presiding.</p><p>The Secretary having read the notice convening the meeting,</p><p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen, as you are aware, this is the formal statutory meeting of our company, at which I have to inform you that the requirements of the Companies Act have been complied with, and that we are now in a position to deal with the business brought before us. The company was incorporated on March 27th, 1905, and the necessary certificate to commence business was obtained on April 11th, 1905. The capital offered for subscription was £200,000, in £1 shares. These were very largely over applied for. To give the exact figures, applications were received for 941,438 shares, of which 584,160 came from Egypt, and the remaining 357,278 were received in London. The company was formed without the assistance of any promoter, and the expenses, which were clearly stated in the prospectus, were paid by the company. With the exception of these expenses, which were exceptionally small, the company started business with its capital intact. Egypt and its affairs are now so well known that I need not allude to the opportunities for remunerative business on a sound basis which can be there obtained. All those interested in the country have learned to wait for, as one of the events of the year, the publication of the annual report of Lord Cromer, showing in detail the continuous records of that marvellous development of the country on all sides, year by year, under the direction of one master mind, which has attracted universal attention. Still, it may be of use to draw attention to a few of the more salient facts—such as the increase of revenue, which last year amounted to L.E. 13,906,152, and was L.E. 2,406,000 in excess of the estimates. Again, the increase of its trade calls for attention, for the imports last year were valued at L.E. 19,889,000, or L E. 3,742,000 more than in 1903, while the exports were valued at L.E. 20,316,000 or L.E. 1,200,000 more than in 1903. This is exclusive of the tobacco trade, which alone is of large dimensions. Every year a stream of gold flows into Egypt, supplied by the increasing numbers of people who visit it for amusement or health or business. Large additional areas are brought under irrigation,and the productive land yields its continuous crops to the patient and laborious cultivator, who is thrifty and lives on little, while he is careful of his money. Wealth is thus accumulated, and there appears to be a strong tendency to invest these savings in land, thereby creating a steady market. As illustrating the disposition of many of the Egyptian investors, it is striking to notice the rising prices quoted for leading stocks in Egypt. The investor there does not appear to look so much to present dividends as to the property and reserve funds acquired by the different corporations. Land and its development is naturally one of the investments which first attracts attention, and although various companies have been recently formed with the object similar to our own, yet there seems no reason to doubt that there is an ample field open for the profitable use of our capital if judiciously invested. The company, in dealing with Egyptian affairs, has the advantage of the services of three directors in Egypt, who have your confidence. These directors are His Excellency Crookshank Pasha, the British representative of the Daira Administration; Mr. Lonsdorfer, the well-known merchant ; aud our Agent-General, Mr. Hooker, who is well known in respect of his public services in Egypt, and greatly respected. As out distinguished director Crookshank Pasha is so intimately connected with the Daira Administration, perhaps you will forgive me for shortly drawing your attention to some of the published results. The whole of the debt is to be liquidated in October next. The rent roll has been increased to no less than L.E.1,094,815. or an average of L.E. 6,52 per acre. With respect to the value of the land, Crookshank Pasha writes as follows : —"With the conversion of the basin irrigation in Middle Egypt into perenoial irrigation, and a constant supply of good water assured by the Assouan dam and Assiout barrage, I am confident that we have not yet reached the highest prices that the land is worth.” This is a view which is shared by many other high authorities. To the same effect is a record of the sales of the Domains’ lands last year, when 2,958 acres were sold by auction. They were estimated at £26 6s per acre, and realised £64 17s per acre. Dealing with agricultural lands, there appears to be a great opening for our comjany in acquiring land which requires reclamation. In any such case, our company would honestly mean to reclaim land thoroughly within a fixed period, and when this was completely effected, sell it in suitable portions, to the small proprietor. I had some years ago to endeavour to assist a somewhat similar class in analogous conditions, and, speaking generally, I can only say that they rendered an exact fulfilment of their obligations, that there were no bad debts, while the investment was remunerative. An important point in connection with these questions is that under the Land Department of the Government it is easy to obtain a registered title, while the fee on transfer has been reduced from 5 per cent. to 2 percent. Dealing with the questions immediately before the directors, they have in hand important business for the acquisition of lands in Cairo. Our agent general, Mr. Hooker, considered it of such moment that he came specially to England to</p><p>confer with the board, and your directors, after going into the matter most carefully with him, as a result of their investigation authorised him to at once return to Egypt to carry out the transactions. You will readily understand that it is inexpedient at present to go more closely into details of pending business,but thedirectors consider that the arrangements when completed will be entirely satisfactory to the shareholders. Besides dealing with land in Cairo, the board have now under consideration the question of acquiring and developing lands in Alexandria for building purposes. In this and all other similar cases the object of the board is only to enter on transactions if the prices are such as to offer a good opening for remuneratively employing a portion of its capital. Your directors have other important business under consideration which is not ripe to put before you to-day. I regret that the company are unable to participate in the issue of a company for the development of one of the large mining concessions on the lines intended, but there are various other enterprises connected with the development of land in Egypt which are now being worked out, and the question as to how far these can be advantageously supported by the company will come before the board. It is not merely that the large centres like Cairo and Alexandria are greatly extending, but improvement is manifested in all parts of the couutry. I can testify to the striking object-lesson of the effects of the administration in Egypt, which is having a marvellous effect in various parts of Asia Minor and the Levant, and people are leaving these latter countries and abandoning property for which they have paid large sums in order to open business and carry on their transactions in Egypt. In one of the important towns on the Syrian coast—in Beyrout—this emigration of those engaged in the largest business has produced a marked effect. It has been represented to us that many of the Egyptian investors desire to pay for their shares in full and obtain bearer warrants, and to meet this demand the directors are having them prepared, and they will shortly be issued to those who desire them. In laying before you so far as I can properly do so the action of the board during the very short period since the company has been formed, it is, of course, necessary to be reticent as to pending business, but I think the shareholders may be assured that the prospects open for the employment of the capital of the company are likely to be fully satisfactory to them, and the company has every prospect of entering upon sound business which must develop and increase, and which, with the continued prosperity of Egypt and its growing volume of trade, must yield good results. In the meantime the capital of the company, while employed on investments realisable at short notice, remains available for the enterprises in prospect, and the shareholders have the satisfaction of knowing that the company has been inaugurated and formed and brought to its preseut position at the least possible cost. As His Excellency Crookshank Pasha is here, I am sure you will like to hear a few words from him. (Hear, hear.)</p><p>His Excellency Crookshank Pasha said that, as the only member of the Egyptian board present in England, he felt it his imperative duty to attend the meeting and emphasise what the chairman had said with regard to Egypt and investments there. He was particularly interested in Egypt and had a great belief in its future. Things marched slowly in the East, but although they had only been in existence a quarter of a year they had already achieved a very considerable success. He was very glad to hear from the chairman that the business they had taken in hand with regard to the purchase of building land in the heart of Cairo was well on way. The difficulty there was that before finally closing the business they have to be quite sure that the title deeds were absolutely correct. When that was done everything would be straight sailing. With regard to Alexandria, that was a large and prosperous oity, and was every day extending all round. They fully expected to establish a very remunerative business, but things did not progress quickly in Egypt. Contrary to the general rule, however, the price of land had gone up in a few years in the most extraordinary way. It was only within the last few years that people had begun to realise what could be made out of land, and this applied to building land as well as to agricultural land. Land which not many years ago could be got at £20 to £30 per acre could not be purchased now under £70 or £90. Again, land which not many years ago was offered them at something under £1 or 15s. a metre could not be purchased now under £10 a metre. The result was that a large number of companies had been started, but they could congratulate themselves on being first in the field, and he had great faith in the future of the company.</p><p>A vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.2. </span><span class="head">MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL. NEW DOCK OPENED BY THE KING.</span></h3><p>King Edward VII. left Lord Derby’s residence at Knowsley on Thursday, accompanied by the Queen, and travelled from there to Manchester, where he opened the new dock which has been added to the Manchester Ship Canal at a cost of £500,000. This new dock, the entrance to which is on the Old Trafford opposite the grain elevator, has been named the King’s Dock. Its length is 2,700 feet, its breadth 250 feet, its depth 28 feet, and it has a water area of 15 acres, so that it is one of the largest docks in the United Kingdom and will accommodate any of our largest vessels. It has been constructed in a series of masonry pier and arches so that when a large vessel enter the "wash" will not be felt by other vessels moored to the quay, as would have been the case were it built of solid masonry. Its steam and electric cranes, subway haulage, quay tracks, sidings, and shed, will enable an unlimited amount of cargo to be dealt with.</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.3. </span><span class="head">ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</span></h3><div class="byline">BY P. P. G.</div><p>IX.</p><p>When my conversation with the Tcherkess had died through the exhaustion of our vocabularies, M. Nicola reappeared and insisted that I should dine with him at the restaurant. There we repaired and in due time got our allowance of vermicelli soup and poached eggs with mastic and glasses of a strong wine. Some Turks and Italians sat there and cracked jokes with the owner of the tent, a grossly fat personage who now and again sang snatches of songs and then clapped his hands and broke into the howl of the Arab <span style="font-style:italic">claqueur</span>. When we left the tent it was bitterly cold (40% Fahrenheit) and I felt myself turning blue, and wondered no more at the sweaters with which the Turks clothed themselves. I was told that water froze on the desert—which is a good 3,000 feet above sea level—till May on cold nights, and that the wind and cold made the winter very trying. Once in bed I got warm enough in no time, the bloodthirsty Circassian giving me a hide of some sort to add to my covers. It had a bad smell but I was too tired to mind, and I slept the sleep of the just till 4 a.m., when I got up and made ready for the morning train. I left at 5 a.m, after quite an agitated scene with M. Nicola, who would not accept a piastre from me and was insulted by the offer, asserting that all Christians in the East should help one another— a most excellent rule, which I followed by leaving a small bottle 2/3rds full of brandy under his desk when he was not looking. I slept in the train till we got to Jurf el Derwish, when some severer jolts than usual aroused me. Some very black Bedouins got in here and promptly took off most of their clothes and slept in their cloaks on the floor.</p><p>The end of the carriage was screened off for a harem with red curtains. Two Turkish ladies, wives of officers at Ma’ân, were behind the curtain attended by a coloured maid and a little boy. No one treated them with any thing but the strictest politeness, and one Arab, who I think must have been the soldier servant of one of the officers, put goulehs of water in through the curtain from time to time, and when we reached the grassland, gathered flowers by the track and handed in rough nosegays. He also acted as nursery governess to a small boy who ran in and out of the "harem” end of the carriage and chattered fearlessly to the Bedouins, who were hugely pleased, and asked him if he would care to come and live with them in the desert.</p><p>One incident which amused me greatly happened about 40 minutes north of Jurf el Derwish. We were descending an inCline with three sharpish curves where the brake was usually put hard down. But the brakesman had curled himself under a seat and we had taken the incline at the alarming speed of 15 miles an hour. The guard suddenly realised the situation. He screeched at the greaser and prodded him with a bayonet, he dragged him from under the seat, and flung him on to the brake at the end of the carriage amidst a variety of curses. We took the next two curves much more quietly.</p><p>At Katranéh the Circassians got into the train. They were perhaps a dozen of the finest-looking msn I have ever seen, tall, clean-limbed, aud as a rule curiously fair. They looked far more like Germans or Swedes than Orientals, aud the imagined contrast between these men and the childish and noisy fellaheen of the type one meets too often in Egypt was painful. These men were the very antipodes of the Egyptian in their quiet manner, their air of alert repose, and above all in the way they eyed the people who were to travel with them. There was none of the rustic cheeriness of the fellah, nothing of the somewhat artificial manner of the Gallicised Bey or Effendi of Egypt. These people were simply well-bred cowboys with just a touch of truculeuoe in their walk and the look of their eyes. One of the Bedouins woke up while the Sharaksa were getting into their places, and said something to his friend which was obviously insulting to the new comers. A Circassian heard and turned round, turned away, and turned again on the Bedonin smiling unpleasantly with half a snarl on his lips. As he smiled he played with his revolver. The Bedouin glared angrily at him for a moment or two and then his gaze dropped before those merciless blue eyes aud he looked first at the floor and then at nothing. The Circassian turned and talked quietly with his fellow troopers, now and again looking back, but the Bedouin did not watch him anymore but lay back on his seat and looked at the steppe.</p><p>(To be concluded)</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.4. </span></h3><p>NOTICE.</p><p>NOTICE is hereby given to all persons having claims against the estate of the late Kaimakam Fell Bey, Inspector, Bahr-el Ghazal Province (Royal Navy), that such claims must be forwarded endorsed as such to the Assistant Adjutant General, War Office, Cairo, to arrive on or before the 7th August, 1905, after which date they will not be taken into consideration.</p><p>26221-6 6</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.5"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.5. </span></h3><p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would call the attention of persons interested in Egyptian trade to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, whose office in Alexandria gives information as to standings trade, &amp;c., to its members, and whose monthly publication reviews our commerce.
