GERMANY AND THE BALTIC.
HaS the recent beat wave, which has visited 
most of the European capitals, affected the 
judgment and the temper of politicians and 
publicists ? It would really seem as if such 
were tho case, for never within our recollection 
has a “silly season” been marked by the 
arrival of such enormous flocks of the political 
and journalistic canard. And the canard 
is a canard sauvage, this summer—and an 
uncommonly savage duck at that. The atmosphere 
is lurid with wan in being, and with 
rumours of wars to Ke: everybody is crouching 
for a spring at somebody else’s throat, 
and, if things do not quiet down a little, it 
will be impossible for Edwin and Angelina 
to take a trip in a Margate pleasure-boat 
this August, without some sapient German 
scribe discovering that the British Navy is 
about to seise a naval base on the coast of 
Switzerland or of Bohemia. The pother which 
is being made about the owning visit of a 
British fleet to the Baltio ia the most curious 
case in point. Things hare certainly 
come to a pretty pass when we find a r
esponsible Berlin newspaper suggesting 
that a combination of the Northern Powers 
should issue a ukase — no, not a 
ukase (ukases are not exactly the mode 
just nowX but the same thing in German — f
orbidding entry into the Baltic Sea to the 
warships of any other Power than those forming 
the new "combine." We should hare thought 
that Europe had had trouble enough with one 
mare clasusum - the Black Sea ; but no. Such 
is the "impishness of circumstances" that no 
sooner has Russia left off trying to break out 
of the Black Sea (having no tools left wherewith 
to effect that operation) than lo I up 
jumps the. "Reiohsbota,” and proposes that a 
similar preserve should be created for the 
benefit of the Powers which lie "contagious,” 
as they say in Ireland, to the Baltic waters. 
And, inasmuch as Russia, Sweden, Norway, 
and Denmark have no navies worth mentioning, 
it is for tha benefit of Germany alone that 
this delightful arrangement is to be called into 
existence. All this because a British fleet 
is going to take a summer cruise where it 
has often cruised before, and will, no 
doubt, often cruise again in time to come.
 We are glad to find, however, that a little consideration 
of the mattes' has not impelled the 
majority of our German comtemporaries to join 
in the cry. They have, no doubt, the sense 
to see that the pretension to make the Baltic a
German lake i^praposterous ; that the many 
millions of British-borne British trade in these 
waters has the right, if necessary, to British 
protection ; that any attempt to forbid it such 
protection could only be successful by force of 
arms ; and that such force is, aa yet, conspicuoos 
by its total absence. We may take it 
for granted that we shall hear very little more 
of the appearance of this particular sea serpent 
in the Baltic Sea.
This pretension to divide the world's waterways 
into "spheres of influence” for the benefit 
of particular nations is, obviously, one by 
which our German neighbours would have 
nothing to gain and very much to lose. For, if 
British warships were forbidden to go into the 
Baltic, German warships would have to be 
forbidden to come out Again, if Germany and 
others were to dose the Baltic, what would 
there be to prevent England and France from 
standing as sentinels over the Straits of Dover?
In short, the more one looks at the Baltic sea-
serpent the more impossible does it appear 
that the creature should ever materialise. He 
should, therefore, he at once relegated to the 
Maseom of International Absurdities, and 
should take his place therein cheek by jowl 
with, let us say, that other fearful wild fowl, 
the Yellow PeriL At the same time, it is 
impossible not to feel a certain amount of irritation 
at the way in which this myth has been 
allowed to oome into being.
It is easy enough to demonstrate, afterwards, 
that all thwo “alaruuu aod axoarsions" are
much ado about nothing; but the fact remains that they breed bad blood, and leave bad effects behind them. Thanks to all this foolish talk, the German people are in danger of forgetting the hospitable reception which the German squadron received last year, at Plymouth, and the previous year at Here haven, and the perfect freedom with whioh German warships were allowed to disport themselves in the waters of the Shetland*. It would be well for Germany and Bog land, and for the peaoe and prosperity of the nations in gen oral, if Germans would lay to heart the solid £act that England has no quarrel with Germany—for the simple reason that Germany nothing that Rnglfnrj ^.n by any possibility oovet, unices it be Germany's growing share in the world's trade. Bat does anybody seriously believe that Great Britain would wantonly attack Germany for the sole purpose of injaring her trade I We have had a long and exhausting war in Sooth Africa and are now convalescent. Are we going to imperil our financial and politioal health by falling on all oar trade rivals 1 Unthinkable—exoept daring a heat wave or the German 'silly season.’


THE MAKING OF ▲ JOURNALIST.
The Hon. Whitelaw Reid, the new American Ambassador in London, ia a famous exeditor and war correspondent, and his views and experience* of newspaper work are auo-cintly put in an article entitled ‘The Newspaper of To-Day” in the Angust number of the "Pall Mall Magazine” :—
Imitate Lord Baoon, and take all knowledge for your province. The average newspaper man on the great dailies is far better educated today than twenty yean ago, but the standard of qualification* is likely in the next twenty to be higher still. Like moat of my oolleaguee on the Press, 1 hare little faith in the “schools of journalism,” or in ”coarses in journalism,” or in “leotures on journalism" either. The only place to learn the newspaper business is in a newspaper office, and you have to be oanght tolerably yonng to learn it at alL But the plaoe to aoquire some of the qualifications for the work is the plaoe where oue gets the best general education the world affords. Above all, it must be an oduoation that teaches you to see straight and to think straight, and therefore its very foundation most not be undermined by too eager a search for easy electives.
We may next look for whatever will fadli-
One must first know things and where to find things, and next know how to interest people in your way of telling these things, and in your reasoning about them. Knowledge, real knowledge, not a smattering of ths history of your oountry, ia indispensable, and no historical knowledge will oome amiss. Constitutional and international law, at least, one must know, and if one oan take a fall oourse, so much the better. Modern languages will be most helpful, and in onr great newspapers a reading knowledge of at least three of them—Prenoh, German, and Spanish—beoomo* every year more desirable. The literature of your own language should be studied until yon learn to nae the noble tongue to express to the best advantage and in the fewest words whatever yon have to say. You should know your own oountry. You should know foreign oountrie*, and thns chasten the notions that wisdom began with us, and that liberty and intelligence hardly exist elsewhere. Yon should know the people, tho people, the plain, everyday, avenge man, the man in the street—his condition, his needs, his ideas, and his notions—and yon should learn early that be is not likely to be overpowered by yonr oondeaoension when yon attempt to reason with him.
