                        revolutionary leaders foreshadow horrors eclipsing any yet recorded. They
                        have ordered the suspension of the general strike for a period of 30 days,
                        and are employing the interval in making the final preparations for an armed
                        rising, unless complete satisfaction is given to the national demands. </p>
                    <p>There are symptoms of defection in the army, and that the troops are prepared
                        to use their arms on the popular side. </p>
                    <p>Reports from the provinces show that there is nothing but turmoil and
                        bloodshed, there being frequent slaughters of Jews. Martial law has been
                        proclaimed at <placeName>Odessa</placeName>, and the Press censorship has
                        been withdrawn. </p>

                <p>We understand that, though nothing has been definitely settled, the new lunatic
                    asylum will probably not be constructed near the desert edge west of Damanhour,
                    in the Behera Province, as was previously expected. The Behera site had certain
                    disadvantages, chief among them the absence of stone quarries which would have
                    greatly increased the cost of construction,a brick building costing at least
                    twice as much as one constructed of local building stone, many good varieties of
                    which are available and abundant, especially near the edge of the
                        <placeName>Eastern (Arabian) desert</placeName>. </p>
                <p>The choice of a site at <placeName>Khanka</placeName>, a lew miles beyond Khanka,
                    is now being discussed, and we understand that <persName>Sir Horace Pinching
                        Pasha</persName>, <persName>Dr. Warnock</persName>, and <persName>Mr.
                        Courtenay Clifton</persName>, the first two representing the Sanitary
                    Department and the latter the Ministry of Public Works, will proceed next week
                    to the spot from Marg and examine the proposed site. The new asylum will
                    probably be built in the hard desert fairly near Khanka—if built in the
                    neighbourhood of Cairo at all—where there are water wells which yield a good
                    supply, and abundance of building stone is within easy reach. The climate of
                    Khanka is good, and the town, which was at one time a fairly important centre,
                    but is said to have been declining recently, may well benefit by the
                    construction of‘the asylum, especially if the Marg-Matarieh railway, as was

                    unpleasant accompaniments of building activity at Cairo. </p>
                <p>To put the matter plainly, in far too many cases, no conveniences of any sort are
                    supplied for the use of the workmen, with the result that an amount of filth is
                    allowed to be spread broadcast in the neighbourhood of these buildings, which is
                    bound to have a prejudicial effect on the health or at least on the comfort of
                    the neighbourhood Dead dogs and cats and other offal are frequently thrown into
                    these sites and may remain there for two or three days, festering and horrible,
                    to the disgust of passers-by. Would it be impossible for the Sanitary Department
                    to force contractors to provide latrines, eta, for the use of the workmen, which
                    could be cleared out from time to time by carts? A rule of this sort has long
                    been applied to all such cases in the British Islands, and has proved a decided
                    success from the point of view of the comfort and health of all concerned. </p>

                    o’clock yesterday evening, it is believed, from heart failure. </p>
                <p>The deceased, who was appointed only two days ago to the Grand Muftiship, in
                    place of the late <persName>Sheikh Mohamed Abdou</persName>, was of the Hanafi sect and enjoyed a
                    great reputation for piety and learning. His death is greatly deplored among
                    Moslem circles, which had been greatly pleased by his recent appointment </p>
                <p>The statement of one of our contemporaries, that the late Grand Mufti was found
                    dead in his carriage on returning from a visit to the British Agency, is not
