                    <p>The King's visit to Paris is, we are told in this morning’s telegrams
                        regarded in the French Capital as a significant political event, and as an
                        affirmation of the “entente" in Moroooo vis-a-vis Germany. It is, indeed,
                        obvious that the visit must be considered to be a political event of
                        considerably greater importance than it would have been if it had taken
                        place a few weeks earlier. France, rightly or wrongly, believes that her
                        powerful Eastern neighbour has taken advantage of the disappearance of the
                        military value of the Dual Alliance to make a belated attempt to question
                        her right to a predominant position in a country where no fair-minded man
                        can deny that her claim is paramount That claim has been recognised by
                        England, and the recognition has been acknowledged by prompt withdrawal of
                        the long-standing French protest against the British position in this
                        country, wherefore it was the duty of England to let it be known to the
                        world that we meant to honour our own signature to the full and the King’s
                        visit to Paris is one of those quiet but effective counter-strokes which are
                        the triumphs of diplomacy. Unless the Kaiser has been the victim of an
                        over-censorius public whose mind is debauched by recollections of Bismarck,
                        the recent parade in Morocco had a very definite object. The growth of
                        intimate relations and of harmony between France and Great Britain has been
                        gall and wormwood to those who inherit the traditions of the Iron
                        Chancellor; and the more we read between the lines of the Emperor's
                        allocution's and of the vapourings of the German newspapers, the more
                        apparent becomes the design to cause a rift within the lute. Of course
                        France must, as she will, respect the commercial rights of Germany (small
                        though they are by comparison with her own or ours) in Morocco. But,
                        inasmuch as she has given the required pledge so to do, there can be no
                        sufficient pretext for the summoning of that European Conference whereof
                        there is some talk in the German Press. The question of Morocco has, in
                        fact, been settled by the Powers concerned, and the sooner Germany accepts
                        that accomplished fact the better for her own dignity, and for that
                        universal peace which, as we know from the Kaiser’s Bremen oration, owes so
                        much to the powerful antiseptic influence of the Teutonic “salt of the
                        earth."</p>

                    <p>The French authorities deny that any of the “Diana's" crew are missing.
                        Portions of the machinery were lately removed because the Commander wished
                        to change his anchorage, and the authorities were anxious to avoid the
                        slightest appearance of a breach of neutrality. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>Paris, April 26.</p>
                    <p>The King’s visit here is regarded as an important political event, and as an
                        affirmation of the “entente" in Moroooo vis-a-vis Germany. The King will

                    <p>The United States cotton crop is an extraordinary one. It exceeds the world’s

                        burning 1,000,000 bales have been futile. (Reuter.)</p>

                        Port Tewfik by an amateur orchestra, consisting of 24 ladies and gentlemen,
                        in and of the Croix Rouge Franchise, under the able management of Mr. Le
                        Dentu, chief engineer f the Suez Canal Company. The two sougs,"Serenata" by

                        accompanied by Miss P. Paleologos, were successfully rendered and heartily
                        applauded. The various selections given by the amateur orchestra, which
                        consisted of Mme Dumont, Mlles Deperais, Paleologos, Tessere, Bovy, and

                        ladies, and Mr. Rose, concluded a delightful evening. Shortly after, dancing
                        commenced, and was kept up to 3 a.m., when a special train was placed at the

                    <p>Dear Mr. Editor,- I and many others were very surprised to read your scanty
                        report on the rendering of Gaul's “Holy City” in St. Mark's Church on
                        Tuesday last. For the past six weeks you have continually mentioned in your
                        columns the progress the choir were making in their practices and in your
                        report no mention whatever is made of Gaul's beautiful music or the way it
                        was rendered, which naturally leads your readers, who were prevented from
                        attending, to conclude the musical part was a fiasco, whereas I am told on
                        good authority it was a success. Surely in Alexandria there could be found
                        one with sufficient musical knowledge to write a fair criticism on such a
                        cantata. I enclose my card and remain, Yours faithfully,</p>

                        prevents us from publishing the criticism, which was prepared for to-day’s
                        issue. It will, however, appear to-morrow. — Ed. EG.]</p>

                        Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, arrived here on his launch
                        yesterday evening. This morning he paid a visit to the Moudirieh, where he
                        made a thorough inspection as usual. He left again this afternoon for Cairo,
                        after expressing his satisfaction with all he had seen.</p>

                    <head>THE CONGO PIGMIES.</head>
                    <p>English people may yet have an opportunity of seeing the interesting figures
                        which Colonel Harrison has brought from the African interior to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>As an objection could hardly be taken at present that the pigmies come under
                        the description of “undesirable aliens," a London representative of the
                        “Pall Mall Gazette” has made special inquiries into the matter, and finds
                        that Lord Lansdowne has been moved to take action solely in the interest of
                        the forest folk themselves.</p>
                    <p>It would appear that when it was first announced that the pigmies were to go
                        to England, several letters were received at the Foreign Office, urging that
                        permission should not be granted tor their removal from Cairo, as it was
                        believed that the severity of the English climate would have an exceedingly
                        bad effect upon them, if, indeed, it did not kill them outright. Lord
                        Lansdowne, moved by the most humane motive, consequently gave orders that
                        the pigmies should be specially examined by the doctors, and even if they
                        were found fit and strong enough to stand the voyage and climate of England,
                        that they should on no account be moved unless they showed perfect
                        willingness to make the journey.</p>
                    <p>This, at present, is as far as the matter has gone, but a definite decision
                        on the question of the English visit may be expected within the next few
                        days.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM SCARE. APPEARANCE AT ABOUKIR.</head>
                    <p>Cotton worm has appeared on some land of the Aboukir Company, near Kharaba
                        Station. The attack, meantime, is not serious, but precautions are being
                        taken to combat it at an early date like this resowing is possible although
                        the crop is naturally later in ripening and runs risk from early rains and
                        cold.</p>

                    <p>The following is the text of the note submitted to the authorities by the
                        entomologist of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, on the worm found in the
                        roots of the young cotton, on the Kasr El Aly estate, Itai el Barud, on the
                        21st inst:—</p>
                    <p>The worm recently submitted to me for examination, with the infomation that
                        they were causing serious damage to the young cotton at Itai El-Barud, is
                        not the true cotton worn, i.e., the larva of the moth “Prodenia littoralis”
                        but the so-called bersim worm, the larva of a Noctuid moth, known as
                        "Agrotis Ypsilan." The latter is a widely distributed species. In America,
                        where it is an important pest, it is known as the "greasy cutworm."</p>
                    <p>Our knowledge of the life-history of this moth in Egypt is somewhat scanty
                        and uncertain; however, what is known about it, I give you below. The female
                        moth lays her eggs at the roots of the young bersim about the middle of
                        October. In the course these eggs give rise to the larva which at first
                        remain on the plant continuously, feeding on the leaves; but in a few days
                        they develop typical cutworn habits, remaining below the surface of the soil
                        during the day and only coming above ground at night; they then cut off the
                        plants at or just below the ground level, devouring the cut portion and also
                        taking a supply down into their burrow's to eat daring the day; on reaching
                        maturity the worms form a cell below' ground and pupate. The moths appear
                        about eleven days later.</p>
                    <p>Eggs are again laid daring the latter half of January and in February at the
                        roots of the bersim. The worms which arise from these eggs feed as before,
                        and, on maturing, pupate. The moths appear about a fortnight later aud give
                        rise to another brood of worms in April. The worms recently sent evidently
                        belong to this April generation. The eggs were laid at the base of the young
                        cotton plants.</p>
                    <p>With regard to treatment, the best thing that can be done under the
                        circumstances is to thoroughly fass, carefully handpick the worms, and
                        re-sow. If bersim in close proximity to cotton is found to be attacked, it
                        would be a good thing to cut or feed off the crop and heavily irrigate. The
                        bersim should be isolated by keeping the ditches full, in order to prevent
                        any migration taking place from it to the cotton.</p>

                    <head>SHIP ON FIRE IN THE CANAL.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>This morning at dawn the S.S. "Candleshoe" arrived from the Canal having
                        reported by wire from Station K. 64 the existence of a fire amongst the
                        cargo in her No. 2 hold.</p>
                    <p>On her arrival she was placed in the petroleum basin, which is situated some
                        2 kilometres from the town, and the necessary fire-extinguishing plant sent
                        alongside. Throughout the day efforts were made to put the fire out by means
                        of small quantities of water and other similar methods, with the idea of
                        doing as little damage to the rest of the cargo as possible; but by 3 p.m.
                        the fire had obtained such a hold that it was deemed neoessary, in order to
                        save the ship, to flood the hold. The big fire float of the Canal Co., "Le
                        Progres,” was already alongside, and she by means of her powerful pumps, had
                        by 5.30 p.m. completely flooded the 'tween decks, in which it was found the
                        fire had done most damage.</p>
                    <p>By sundown, gangs of Arabs were at work discharging the cargo, and the ship’s
                        main pumps were at work pumping out the water.</p>

                    <p>Visitors to the Gaiety or Daly's Theatre in London go there on one
                        understanding, i.e., they are not to criticise the play, and those who went
                        to see the “Orchid" on Tuesday night ought to have made the same mental
                        reservation (and we hope that it was not taken as the standard of English
                        drama by our Continental neighbours). Personally, we have never visited the
                        inside of a "Horticultural College," but we cannot quite see why it should
                        be the most appropriate place for diplomats, doctors, and debutantes to
                        foregather and settle matters of vital interest, the said matters being —
                        Heaven knows why!— entirely at the mercy of an eccentric gardener! We
                        returned from the entr'acte to find the characters meeting for some abstruse
                        reason in Paris, where it seems that one can appear alternately in
                        travelling kit, evening dress, or fancy costume, nay more, to fight lengthy
                        duels, and all in broad daylight. One's mind is in such a chaos by now that
                        one ignores soch astounding devices to aid the plot (sic) as finding the
                        orchid on a street-barrow, or allowing it to be carried in a lady's hat and
                        can only admire the ingenuity of the writer who evoked the "synopsis" so
                        thoughtfully provided on the programme.</p>
                    <p>As to the rendering of the piece, the change of climate from Saturday night
                        had brought a great improvement in the company.The success of the play was
                        undoubtedly due to the first rate comic acting of Mr. Ralph Roberts, who
                        made all his points very cleverly and showed a rare and natural turn for
                        humour that promises him a future on the stage equal to that of his
                        prototype, Edmund Payne. Miss Corlass gave a most cheery and attractive
                        rendering of “Josephine," and with Mr. O’Connor made a great hit in their
                        duet, "Ah me! alack a day! alas"; the latter forms a welcome relief to the
                        rest of the music, which is mostly traditional and obvious. Miss Morra's
                        rendering of "Little Mafy" greatly pleased the house, and Mr. Cotter scored
                        another success in the humorous if easy part of Comte Raoul, while M.
                        Twyser, as the "Registrar" was determined that his brief lines should not be
                        lacking in laughter, anyhow on one side of the footlights.</p>

                        and the entrances" of the different characters, that the attention of the
                        andience was too often concentrated on the occupants of the boxes rather
                        than upon the stage, while the duet should have occupied a fifth of the time
                        it did. This want of “go" was to be regretted, and we suggest to the
                        management to remedy this defect, for we think that by so doing they could
                        guarantee a great success in their final performances with such an array of
                        talent at their disposal.</p>

                    <head>FREYCINET ON FASHODA. THE LAST OF A MISUNDERSTANDING.</head>
                    <p>. de Freycinet, ex-Prime Minister, has been writing a book. ("La Question de
                        Egypt"). It will shortly be published. This is a most opportune time, for it
                        constitutes a strong argument for perpetual peace and friendship between
                        France and England.</p>
                    <p>M. de Freycinet’s chapter on Fashoda and the meeting there between Marchand
                        and Kitchener is frankly and entirely a justification of England, and at the
                        same time a refutation of the current charge, made by the Parisian Jingoes
                        of the time, that in withdrawing Marchand from Fashoda the French Government
                        “surrendered everything."</p>
                    <p>“There was nothing to surrender," is M. de Freycinet's reply. But though
                        England's case was clearly just M. de Freycinet points out that the English
                        Cabinet's way of going to business was in some respects objectionable. To
                        this it is that he attributes the misunderstandings which, in the estimation
                        of the French and English publics, might end in war.</p>
                    <p>What England ought to have said, from first to last, argues M. de Freycinet,
                        was that, as the protectress of Egypt she was simply assisting her protegee
                        to the reoovery of the Nile dominions that had been temporarily abandoned
                        during the Mahdist revolt, and which the public law of Europe had already
                        recognised as being Egyptian under the Sultan's suze rainty. But as it was,
                        the French public was at a loss to know whether England was acting solely on
                        Egyptian behalf, or simply on her own — in which case, as the newspapers
                        argued. Fashoda would become the property of the first comer, Marchand or
                        Kitchener.</p>

                    <head>FASHIONABLE MARRIAGE. STEINAUER-BREWSTER</head>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon^t 4 o’clock, the marriage of Miss Lina Brewster and Mr.
                        Max E. Steinauer, the well-known contractor, was celebrated at St. Joseph’s
                        Roman Catholic Church in Cairo. The service was attended by hosts of the
                        many friends of the bride and bridegroom and their parents, and the smart
                        toilettes and handsome floral decoration of the church made a very charming
                        picture. The Rev. Father Battiglia officiated at the marriage, and hit
                        address to the bride and bridegroom made a great impression on the
                        congregation. It was incisive, full of deep feeling, in perfect taste, and
                        thoroughly in keeping with the solemnity of the marriage service.</p>
                    <p>The bride's dress was of creme satin with silk tulle and trimmed with silk.
                        Mrs. Brewster Bey was very elegantly dressed in black silk tucked voile with
                        ivory lace insertions and a pretty hat trimmed with olive green. The bride
                        carried a beautiful and costly bouquet from the 'De Rouge' with orange
                        blossoms, and the bridesmaids carried bouquets, while the four "garcons
                        d'honneur" wore white favors. In ths church the following order was observed
                        by bridesmaids and best men: first, Mr. Fitspatriok and Miss Adele Brewster,
                        second, Dr. Santenecchi and Miss Dupont; followed by Mr. Waller and Miss
                        Ponsford and Mr. Edouard Rose and Mlle Reboul.</p>
                    <p>Among the congregation were nearly all the high officials of the Palace, and
                        three of H.H. the Khedive’s carriages, one coupe and two landaus, were drawn
                        up outside in charge of his Highness's own coachmen and grooms. On the
                        conclusion of the ceremony a reception was held at the Grand Continental
                        Hotel, where carriages came in a regular procession. The salon on the left
                        of the entrance had been chosen for the reception, and was quickly crowded
                        by numbers of guests anxious to congratulate the bride and bridegroom and
                        their hosts, on the happy event. It is difficult to estimate even
                        approximately the number of the guests, and we are convinced that there will
                        be some notable omissions in the list we give of those who were present at
                        the marriage service or the reception. We noticed H.H. Prince Mahmoud Hamdi
                        and several of the Ministers, including Mazloum Pasha and Fakhry Pasha,
                        Yacoub Pasha Artin, Mr. Alban, Mr. and Mrs. Sciortino, Mr. A.L. Webb, M.
                        Riffart, Thurneyssen Pasha and nearly all the principal officials of the
                        Palace, Nakhle Bey, M. and Mme Bergere, Mr. Aspinall, Chakour Pasha, Osman
                        Pasha Cherif, Mme Mlle Reboul, Mr. and Mrs. Wildt, Mr. and Mrs. I.M. Chinn,
                        Mr. A. J. Cotterill, M. Dupont, Mr. Bandmann, Mr. Beale, Mr. Plunkett, Mr.
                        Geoffrey Milward, Mr. R. Carton de Wiart, etc.</p>
                    <p>The bouquets in the reception room were universally admired and deserved the
                        admiration they won. Among the given of bouquets were M. and Mme. A. Guetin.
                        M. and Mme. R. Carton de Wiart, M. E. Rose, Mr. A. Smith, Dr. Issa Pasha
                        Hamdi, M. and Mme. J. Rose, Lt-CoL J.K. Watson, Thurneyseen Pasha, Mr. G.

                    <p>We give a list (in French, owing to the difficulty of translating the list
                        forwarded us in time) of the presents, some of which we intend to describe
                        in greater detail. The witnesses for the bride at the marriage ceremony wore
                        De Martino Pasha and Dr. Murison, the bridegroom’s witnesses, M. Guetin and
                        M. Charvaut. Telegrams expressing the good wishes and regrets of those who
                        had been invited but were unable to attend the reception were received all
                        through the afternoon, and Mme. De Martino, though called out to Koubbeh
                        Palace, returned in time to congratulate the bride long before the reception
                        was over. A well stocked buffet was provided for the guests. At seven came
                        the last episode, when the bride, who had put on a brown travelling dress
                        trimmed with green, left the hotel amid the general good wishes and
                        congratulations of all who were present, punctuated with showers of
                        rice.</p>
                    <p>The newly-married pair leave Alexandria to-morrow by Russian steamer for
                        Athena, and will then visit Corfu, Trieste, Vienna, Venice, Milan, Rome,
                        Florence, Naples, and Paris, returning to Egypt after an absence of 2 months
                        via Marseilles.</p>

                    <p>(From our Fiancial Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, April 20.</p>
                    <p>Idleness is still the ruling feature of the stock markets - the Easter
                        holidays and the uncertainty of the present state of the war in the East
                        tend to put a checl on any fresh buisness, and, in the meantime, prices
                        weaken. Japanese stocks naturally suffer, for sea fighting is always open to
                        accidents, but Japan has had so long to prepare for the coming fray, and has
                        shown such a very able seamanship up to the present, that she should put a
                        finishing touch to the sea campaign this time, and there should be a sharp
                        recovery in Japanese stocks.</p>

                    <p>In Egyptian issues, Daira Sanieh shares are the main point of interest. There
                        has been large and persistant buying from Egypt, and the price has been even
                        up to 28 1/4, which, for the present, looks high enough, though, the market
                        talks them up to 30 and over. Bank shares are still firm. Nationals at 37
                        3/8 and Agriculturals 13 1/4. Other prices show litte change.</p>

                    <p>There is a little recovery in Egyptian mines and Um Rus have improved on a
                        good return from the mines. There is fortunately, a lull in the rush of new
                        issues, and we trust that this may continue for a while, both for the sake
                        of existing and prospective properties.</p>

                    <p>The general tone of markets is by no means bad, and we should see better
                        markets all round next month.</p>

                        be retarded by cold and unfavorable weather, no one as yet, apparently,
                        attaches much importance to it. The information as to the area likely to be
                        planted and the use of fertilisers is still indefinite, and to some extent
                        contradictory.</p>

                        Courtiers L'affaire .la Mrs. Biistros frères contre la Société lo U Bourse
                        Khédiviale d'Alexandrie et l'Association dos courtiers en Valeurs et
                        Marchandises a été plaidée hier inatin -dorant la Ire’ Chambre do la Cour,
                        présidée par Mon Sieur de Korianict. Me Albério Le Moine S'est présenté pour
                        Ica appelants, Bustroa frères ; Me Palagi pour la Société de la Bourse
                        Khédiviale et MesSœoli et-Ooluoci pour les Courtiers. Quoique les débats
                        aient été relativement très courts,, tout a été dit -de part et d'autre. Me
                        Le Moine a invoqué les principes de droit ' et la loi olle-mênle (art. 72 du
                        Code de Coin tneroe) pour démontrer cpio le Tribunal a fait erreur eh
                        déboulant ses clients ; il a expliqué que les procédés de 1‘Association des
                        Courtiers d'Alexandrie, inexistante en droit mais exis tante eu fiait, sont
                        do nature i» constituer l’en ' trave la plus reprochàble au libre exercice
                        do la pression de courtier puisqu’on dehors d’eux et-saus le concours do scs
                        membres il est impossible de faire des atlairos en Bourse; qu’il y. a ainsi
                        non seulement une sorte de monopole et d'accaparement du marché ‘‘dit
                        public”, mais qu’il existe entr’ôux une coalition quo .socle la Justice peut
                        réduire à néant ; que do son cOté la Société de la Bourse Khédiviale a
                        contrevenu à ses accords avec le (Gouvernement ot h ses propres statuts en
                        no traitant pas fe public d’une façon égale et en autorisant, dan.
                        l'enoeiute d'uïjnarché qui doit rester public, uno'tocation jfpécLle et
                        ['établissement de 2 corbeilles uti les affaires se traitent exclusive ment
                        et dans Tunique intérêt de l’assemblée des courtiers qui eo trouve ainsi
                        nantie d’ane faveur qui ooniïne au privilège. Donc, d’après MeLoMoine,le
                        tout constitue un état de choses intolérable, allant k Tenooutre du principe
                        de liberté voulue par le législateur, d'autant plus que les courtiers
                        groupés en association ont admis, en mémo temps qu’ils refusaient l’aocè.
                        dos corbeilles h Mrs. Bustros frères, des postulants qui n'offraient pas
                        tontes les garanties pécuniaires reconnues unanimement au profit de Mrs.
                        Bustros frères ; le motif d’exclusion de la raison Sociale Bustros,
                        inattaquable au point do vno de l’honorabilité et de la solvabilité,
                        résiderait donc dans l'intérêt que les membres de l’Assemblée des Courtiers
                        avaient d’écarter uno concurrencé des plus périlleuses pour eux. Me Palagi a
                        exposé que la Société de la Bourse Khédiviale ne saurait être recherchée par
                        Mrs. Bustros frères avec lesquels elle n’a aucun lieu de droit, les
                        appelants n’ayant pas à se prévaloir de ses conventions privées avec le
                        Gouvernement ; il ajoute que d’ailleurs la société a toujours respecté ses
                        engagements et qa’èlle a maintenu h l'immeuble et à ses dépendances la
                        destination qui lui avait été imposée. Si Mrs. Busaros ne peuvent exercer,
                        comme ils l’entendent, leur profession de courtiers, qu’ils s'eu prennent h
                        l’Association des Courtiers mais non h la Société qui ne fait
                        personnellement pas obstacle h. leurs prétentions. . Me Soooli soufrent que
                        i’actioo des appelants est irrecevable et infondée, qu’il est étou-nant de
                        voir'des gens attaquer nue association qui s’oet fondée précisément en
                        raison des principes de liberté que Mrs. Bustros sont en train de détruit en
                        se plaignant d’une entrave qu’eux-mémes apporteraient ainsi à l'indépendance
                        de tous en l'absenoo d’un texte légal qui la restreigne. Libre aux appelants
                        de faire des opérations de courtage oh et comme ils l'entendent/• mais ils
                        ne peuvent se plaindre plus longtemps, sous peine d’être accusés de dépit et
                        de rancune, d’avoir été refusés par le vote de la majorité. Me S rooli
                        n’admet pas que les membres de Tassooiation soient eux-mêmes gênés dans leur
                        liberté, et s’il leur a pltTdo s’organiser et ensuite de no pas admettre la
                        candidature dos appelant', ceux-ci n’ont auoon moyeu ni aucun texte légal k
                        invoquer contre le* intimés. Me Coluoci plaide également que Tactipn des
                        appelants ne se justifie pas en droit, chacun étant ht demeurant maître chez
                        soi. Les appelants, dit-il, ont toute latitude, en l’état de leurs relations
                        et de leur fortune, de faire des affaires et d’établir leur sphère
                        d’activité en dehors de l'association des courtiers ; mais per-sonnb ne peut
                        obliger les membres de la dite association h traiter aveo les appelants ; et
                        Me Coluoci insiste pour prévoir qoe cet état de choses ne se modifiera pas
                        vis-Avis des appelants. Me Le Moine réplique en précisant quo le règlement
                        de Tasssociation des courtiers est préjudiciable k ses clients eo ce sens
                        que l’application du dit règlement équivaut a un sys tème d’exolurivisme au
                        détriment de oeux qui ne font pas partie de l’association et qu'ainst les
                        appelants ont le droit de se plaindre d'une entrave apportée an libre
                        exercice de leur profession, entrave injustifiable en droit et injustifiée
                        en fiait. Monsieur te Procureur Général Borchgre-vinck a demandé

                    <head>TANTAH LAST WEEK. ALL THE FUN OF THE FAIR.</head>
                    <p>(From a Tantah Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Tantah, April 23.a</p>
                    <p>The celebration of the fair of Sayed El Badawi ai Tantah, the capital of
                        Lower Egypt and where the stupendous mosque of the saint stands wnh its
                        numerous lofty minarets, has takon last week a new aspect to the approaching
                        visitor from Cairo or Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Indeed the celebration of the fair this year after a long cession of four
                        years, as circumstances then necessitated, reptosented to the eye of the
                        aged native who in olden time had opportunity or rather an ill fate to
                        endure the heavy weight of miracles to have in the those dark ages of
                        tyranny and oppression, the difference a wide scope between the cursed old
                        days of injustice and the present dreamt of days of liberty and freedom.</p>
                    <p>It is indeed very striking to observe the aged fellah now sitting in the best
                        coffee house he chooses, where the high officiais and notables usually meet,
                        in enjoying both the liberty granted him and the drink most suitable to his
                        taste fearing neither criticism nor threatening. </p>
                    <p>The fair, oh, the grand fair, the splendid fair, but after all the
                        destructive fair that attracts but to injure, that calls but to ruin, that
                        fascinates but to murder, and at length the great Egyptian fair, that does
                        not in any way correspond with the technical definition of the word.</p>
                    <p>A fair is a great periodical market devoted either to one kind of merchandise
                        or to afford opportunity for most of the sales and purchase of articles. In
                        Egypt a fair is a feast or say a holiday devoted to immorality, indecency,
                        drunkenness and useless extravagance. The word is abusively used and thus
                        Tantah during those days of the “Mulid” was infected with what is commonly
                        cailed “false pleasure.”</p>
                    <p>The town was really in motion, the men of the Delta Light Railways and the
                        State Railways, the Markets were delighted beyond measure; the hotels were
                        thickly peopled to such a degree that you could scarcely find lodging for
                        half a pound per night; (the estimate made by the Railway Administration
                        shows that 700,000 persons hâve come to Tanteh during the fair, this of
                        course besides those who came on foot or on camel backs), the cafés were
                        filled to éxcess and the Greek wine merchants used to meet the fellah with a
                        smiling jaw of welcome.</p>
                    <p>At night the town from the south represented a most striking view. Hundreds
                        of tents and kisqnes looked like domes illuminated with hundreds of lantems
                        from the outside and decorated with chandeliers from the interior which was
                        occupied by notables and religions men engaged in making the ‘Zikr' which in
                        no way agrees with the Mohammedan Laws and which the foreigners are
                        apologised to criticise when they see it. Men, women and children of
                        different families and localities slept together on the ground near the
                        tents, thus causing much coquetry or at least casting some doubt.</p>
                    <p>The natives used to come till last Friday almost on camel backs set with
                        sedan chairs and led by the moon light. Camels are fond of singing and thus
                        the riders on entering Tantah were heard singing sweet Arabis ballads that
                        reminded the audience of the ancient Arabs and how they travelled before
                        railways were constructed.</p>
                    <p>The mosque, the small university, but after all the second largest in the
                        country, was visited by hundreds and hundreds of fellahs who are still
                        ignorant to kiss the threshold of the mosque and talk to the dead occupant
                        to help them. Last Friday there was an impressive tragic scene in the
                        mosque. The visiters met in the mosque for performing Friday prayers. So
                        much was the crowd that there was much fighting in the mosque for seats and
                        the result was that a poor fellah was beaten to death.</p>
                    <p>A noncommissioned officer was charged of having played a part in the tragody
                        and an inquiry by the Parquet is still proceeding. There were many dancing
                        caffes through the Mudir had alrearly issued an order to stop such folly
                        during the Mulid. There were many public women of some artificial beauty (if
                        I may be permitted to say so) that persuaded many rich fellahs to open
                        hundreds and hundreds of bottles of beer which action is considered as a
                        token of loyalty and true love.</p>
                    <p>In short Cairo and its follies flew with the current that brought the news of
                        the celebration of the fair. Friday has passed with its bad omens and the
                        visitors are returning to their residence after leaving heaps of dirt that
                        require a long time to clear away.</p>
                    <p>When will such follies cease? When will the Egyptians recover their senses
                        and copy with keen interest useful manners of the Europeans? When will the
                        men of religion probibit such nonsense? When will the conntry enjoy true
                        pleasure? are questions the answers for which have impatiently been longed
                        for. I do not mean that fairs should be stopped altogether, but I only dream
                        of the day when such fairs will represent to the occidentals the decency and
                        magnanimity of the Egyptians</p>

                    <p>London, April 14.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. G. M. Blomfield, 4th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment, at the
                        Curragh, has been selected for service with the Egyptian Army and is to
                        proceed at once to Cairo. Captain Blomfield joined the Warwicks seven years
                        ago, and has commanded a company for the past three and a half years. He is
                        the son of Rear-Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield, of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The date of the move of the 1st Battalion Royal Inuiskilling Fusiliers from
                        Derry to Belfast has not yet been definitely announced, but most likely it
                        will take place in September, after the summer drills. It is many years
                        since the old 27th Inniskillings were in Belfast. The 2nd Battalion, now at
                        Cairo, was there in the “eighties."</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. M. Goltz, the man who was the cause of the Boer War of 1881 which
                        ended in a British defeat at Majuba Hill, has just died at the Cape. Mr.
                        Goltz was landdrost at Poldrefstown and in virtue of his office seized the
                        waggons of a Dutch farmer, Piet Bezuidentwut, who had refused to pay taxes
                        to the British Government. This act precipitated the Boer outbreak.</p>

                    <p>On recommissioning for two years' further service on the Mediterranean
                        Station, Captain P. P. Tillard has been reappointed to the command of the
                        battleship “London.” She will be refitted at Malta.</p>

                    <p>The mining operation formerly carried on by the ships of the Mediterranean
                        Fleet in the Levant during the winter months are to be discontinued.</p>

                    <p>The new plans devised by the Admiralty for the improvement of the gunnery
                        practice of the Navy came into effect for the first time this year. The name
                        of “annual test of gunlayers” has been given to the preseribed competitions.
                        As far as possible the firing will be under similar conditions to those
                        which would pertain on active service. No black powder will be used, and the
                        distance of the target from the ship will be varied considerably, ranging
                        from 1,400 yards up to 3,000 yards.</p>

                    <p>Some of the targets for these competitions will be fixed to rafts, the size

                    <p>.The story now being told about the tactful way in which Vice-Admiral Sir W.
                        H. May rebuffed the Kaisers curiosity during his Imperial Majesty’s visit to
                        “King Edward VII." reads like one narrated of the Kaiser and a bluejacket
                        The German Emperor has the bump of inquisitivenees pretty fully developed.
                        Whilst going over a British man-of-war some few months ago he asked
                        continual questions of the men be saw at varions duties. "I do not know your
                        Majesty,” was the invariable reply he got. At last the Kaiser suspecting
                        that the ignorance was assumed, not real, said with a smile to the
                        signalman, “You do not intend that I should learn much aboard this ship? "I
                        do not know, your Majesty," answered the man. Turning to the officer who
                        accompanied him the Kaisor remarked laughingly, "If your men can fight as
                        well as they can keep their counsel they should be invincible.”</p>

                    <p>F Company v. D Company.</p>
                    <p>The above teams met at Abbassieh in the second round of the Football Shield
                        and League. D Company possess eight points, while F Company are creditod
                        with seven points for the same number of matches. Both teams put on their
                        most available eleven, Duffy, Portis, and Percy making a welcome appearance
                        after their recent injuries. At the appointed time for starting the referee
                        lined his men out in the full wing order : F Company — Goal, Collins ;
                        backs, Duffy and Page ; half backs, Weir, Bond, and Portis ; forwards,
                        Percy, Sweeney, Smith, Templeton, and Bradshaw. D Company—Goal, Dudgeon ;
                        backs, Williamson and Raftees ; half-backs, Guerin, Ardis, and Johnstone ;
                        forwards, Prealey, Davis, Gray, Gorman, and Ellis. There would be about 400
                        spectators present when Captain Smyth, having won the spin of the coin,
                        elected to defend the roadway goal. Play in the opening favored P Company,
                        who got away per Sweeney, but Williamson relieved by sending into touch.
                        Dudgeon was now called upon to handle, which he did well. D Company now got
                        down but Page and Duffy sent them to the right about. Things looked glum for
                        the red and white brigade as Percy missed by a hair’s breadth. On the kick
                        off D Company pressed but Davis shot very wide. The green’s front rank got
                        away per Smyth, who passed to Sweeney, who in turn gave to Percy and the
                        latter dodging Williamson sent in a nice centre and Smyth rushing in had no
                        trouble in scoring the first goal for P Company. On resuming D Company tried
                        to get away but Bond was proving himself a good half-bsck and play, was
                        reversed towards Dudgeohi but Johnstone relieved, but too late to avert
                        disaster, as Bond with a terrible grounder sent up the second goal for the
                        Greenshirts. A little rough play was now indulged in. P Company were having
                        matters all their own way and forced a corner, which proved of no value. For
                        the third time in this half D Company crossed half ways but Gray’s parting
                        shot went wide Smyth, Templeton. and Bradshaw were now seen to advantage and
                        one shot of Templeton deserved a better fair Midfield play now followed for
                        a while until Smyth got away, but Johnstone relieved and Davis got down.
                        Portis, however, was on his track and operations were once more round
                        Dudgeon and company, and Dudgeon cleared his citadel once more. A free was
                        awarded against D Company for a breach of the rules. Duffy was entrusted
                        with the kick—a fast shot and a good one, the ball finding the top corner of
                        the net, making number three. From this on D Company were a beaten team and
                        never once did they show the same play or dashing runs as their opponents,
                        who deserved their goals on play. D Company now wakened up and Guerin put on
                        a spurt but Weir and Boud were ever on the move and the “little ’un” did not
                        get far. At this stage the front rank of the greens were playing a most
                        magnificent and surprising game and it was of little wonder to Dudgeon when
                        Percy slipped the fourth one past him. D Company now realized their position
                        and made tracks for Collins (who up to this was a spectator) but he was not
                        called upon to handle as Elliot sent past half-time was now approaching as
                        Percy made a burst away and eluding a couple of opponents centred, but
                        Templeton sent sky high over the bar when with a litte more judgment he must
                        have found the desired spot. From this until half time F Company had matters
                        all their own way. Half-time score:- </p>
                    <p>F Company ........... 4 Goals.</p>
                    <p>D Company .......... Nil.</p>

                    <p>After the usual interval and refreshments both teams took the field again.
                        Smyth started tho second moiety and Peroy was the means of takiug play
                        towards Dudgeon, but Raftus relieved tbe pressure and Prosley got on a good
                        ran, but Portis was on him and play vrai seen in the vicinity of Dudgeon,
                        where a scrimmage ensned. Bradsbaw, bowever, sent past. On the kiok-off D
                        Company got away bat Page and Daffy were ail O. K. and retnrn-«d time after
                        time. The red and white-shirtied brigade were playing a better game in this
                        half than in the pravioas one. Collins was cailed aÿ6n to bandle, which he
                        did in a clever mannerftjBough play was the order for some time, 9«0rin
                        being responsible. A corner for F Company looked bine for D Company.
                        Artis,-bowever, saved the sitnation only to see Bond return the leather
                        towards Dudgeon, but the latter saved by sending into touch. Some give and
                        take p'ay followod, for so far P_Com-were having the best of exchanges and
                        Peroy and Sweeney were playing woll together. and it took Dudgeon to be in
                        his best forai or ls8 the soore would hâve been a lot larger. .Atthia stage
                        Percy was showing some of Steve Bloomer's old form and getting away on his
                        own be sent a terrifie cross shot in to the nustodian, who in saving
                        oonceded a corner. This was well taken by Portis, but Williamvn relieved.
                        Tbe Greens were now put on tbe défensive but Bond was playing a hard game
                        and robbed Gorman time and again, for so far only one team was in it and
                        that team (as may be readily guessed) was not D Company. The spectatora now
                        nrged their favorites to play np. 8myth got away and eludiog a couple of
                        opponents be gave to Peroy, bot tbe latte* was given off eide and this
                        helped to pnt *h* greens on the defenoe. Howaver, EUint wher in a good
                        position sent wildly part. On re»nm ing the green brigade got agoing. 8ome
                        excit ing play was witnessed "between Smyth an* Gray, the former ooming ont
                        beat P Companj were now playing a splendid oombinatioi game and Smyth vrai
                        proving himulf this missing link as centre forward for the greens. The way
                        he fed his wingi was a pcrfect treat to watch. Tho best run of the match now
                        took place, Peroy, takiDg the bail along the touch line, sent in a fast
                        croes shot which the custodian failed to reach, this being the fifth final
                        and last goal of thp match. Even play now followed until the long wbistle
                        sounded for full time, leaving P Company winnera of a sensational match by
                        the following soore :—</p>
                    <p>P Company .............. 5 Goals</p>

                        expected it was not so great as anticipated. The “Tier el-Mina" again won in

                    <p>Nahwy, or Mispronunciation.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the chief value of Mr. Willmore’s book is that it forms the first
                        Pronouucing Dictionary of Spoken Arabic for English students. However much
                        you may pride yourself on your knowledge of literary Arabic, however much
                        you may despise the vernacular, take our advice and read Willmore's
                        exercises aloud, first to youraetf, then to your servant, who will be
                        astonished at the wonderful book from which his master reads aloud the true
                        spoken language. And after that you need not fear the opprobrious epithet of
                        "nahwy," or pedantry, being applied to you. Pronounce properly, and you may
                        indulge in the highest-flown Arabic. Pronounce badly, and you will remain a
                        "nahwy."</p>
                    <p>Why is it that some of us who have lived 20 years in the country and have
                        studied classical authors, are still a failure in speaking Arabic?? Because
                        we have never taken the trouble to learn the correct pronunciation. Why is
                        that some young officers and civilians, new-comers, are such a success in
                        Arabic? Because they have a correct ear, and have picked up the true accent
                        like children, so that their native subordinates swear by them as being good
                        scholars, “yaraf arabi tayyib.” Here is a short lesson:-</p>
                    <p>The article is “il," and not "al.” You should say il-beit, lefendi, lingliz,
                        not el beit, el efondi, or el-ingliz. Auwil, first, and not awwaL. Use the
                        vowel “i” whenever you can rather than a or u. Soften the a and u. Say
                        id-duhr, noon, not ed dohr. Say iddihni, give it to me, and not aateeni
                        zalik. Do not say ala shan, but ashan, for, on account of.</p>
                    <p>Do not say for “did you not hear me,” ma samaataneesb, but ma smihtineesh? On
                        every page you will find something of interest in pronunciation. Buy the
                        book, test it with any Arab you like, of any class, and you will find the
                        verdict unanimous that the prononciation is perfect. In conclusion we may
                        say that this is a book especially intended for beginners, with graduated
                        exercises. It has been compiled with infinite pains, a conscionsness of
                        which grows upon the student as he turns the pages. A monumental work which
                        will live. C.</p>
